This UN plan specified borders for new Arab and Jewish states and also specified an area of Jerusalem and its environs which was to be administered by the UN under an international regime. The end of the British Mandate for Palestine was set for midnight on 14 May 1948. That day, David Ben-Gurion, the executive head of the Zionist Organization and president of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, declared &quot;the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel,&quot; which would start to function from the termination of the mandate. The borders of the new state were not specified in the declaration. Neighboring Arab armies invaded the former Palestinian mandate on the next day and fought the Israeli forces. Israel has since fought several wars with neighboring Arab states, in the course of which it has occupied the West Bank, Sinai Peninsula (1956–57, 1967–82), part of Southern Lebanon (1982–2000), Gaza Strip (1967–2005; still considered occupied after 2005 disengagement) and the Golan Heights. It extended its laws to the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem, but not the West Bank. Efforts to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict have not resulted in peace. However, peace treaties between Israel and both Egypt and Jordan have successfully been signed. Israel's occupation of Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem is the world's longest military occupation in modern times.[note 2]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the UN recommend the Partition Plan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">29 November 1947</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the end of the British Mandate set?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">midnight on 14 May 1948</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the executive head of the Zionist Organization?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">David Ben-Gurion</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Israel (/ˈɪzreɪəl/ or /ˈɪzriːəl/; Hebrew: יִשְׂרָאֵל‎ Yisrā'el; Arabic: إِسْرَائِيل‎ Isrāʼīl), officially the State of Israel (Hebrew: מְדִינַת יִשְׂרָאֵל‎ Medīnat Yisrā'el [mediˈnat jisʁaˈʔel] ( listen); Arabic: دولة إِسْرَائِيل‎ Dawlat Isrāʼīl [dawlat ʔisraːˈʔiːl]), is a sovereign state in Western Asia.

It shares land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria in the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories (which are claimed by the State of Palestine and are partially controlled by Israel) comprising the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. It contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv while Jerusalem is both the self-designated capital and most populous individual city under the country's governmental administration.

Jewish presence in the region significantly dwindled after the failure of the Bar Kokhba revolt against the Roman Empire in 132 CE. Nevertheless, there was a continuous small Jewish presence and Galilee became its religious center. The Mishnah and part of the Talmud, central Jewish texts, were composed during the 2nd to 4th centuries CE in Tiberias and Jerusalem. The region came to be populated predominantly by Greco-Romans on the coast and Samaritans in the hill-country. Christianity was gradually evolving over Roman paganism, when the area stood under Byzantine rule. Through the 5th and 6th centuries, the dramatic events of the repeated Samaritan revolts reshaped the land, with massive destruction to Byzantine Christian and Samaritan societies and a resulting decrease of the population. After the Persian conquest and the installation of a short-lived Jewish Commonwealth in 614 CE, the Byzantine Empire reconquered the country in 628.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Jewish presence dwindle in the region?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">132 CE</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who conquered the country in 628?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Byzantine Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was evolving over Roman paganism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christianity</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the siege of Jerusalem by the First Crusade in 1099, the Jewish inhabitants of the city fought side by side with the Fatimid garrison and the Muslim population who tried in vain to defend the city against the Crusaders.

At this time, a full thousand years after the fall of the Jewish state, there were Jewish communities all over the country. Fifty of them are known and include Jerusalem, Tiberias, Ramleh, Ashkelon, Caesarea, and Gaza. According to Albert of Aachen, the Jewish residents of Haifa were the main fighting force of the city, and &quot;mixed with Saracen [Fatimid] troops&quot;, they fought bravely for close to a month until forced into retreat by the Crusader fleet and land army.

In 1922, the League of Nations granted Britain a mandate over Palestine under terms which included the Balfour Declaration with its promise to the Jews, and with similar provisions regarding the Arab Palestinians.

Finally, the rise of Nazism and the increasing persecution of Jews in 1930s Europe led to the Fifth Aliyah, with an influx of a quarter of a million Jews. This was a major cause of the Arab revolt of 1936–39 during which the British Mandate authorities alongside the Zionist militias of Haganah and Irgun killed 5,032 Arabs and wounded 14,760, resulting in over ten percent of the adult male Palestinian Arab population killed, wounded, imprisoned or exiled. The British introduced restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine with the White Paper of 1939. With countries around the world turning away Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust, a clandestine movement known as Aliyah Bet was organized to bring Jews to Palestine. By the end of World War II, the Jewish population of Palestine had increased to 33% of the total population. On July 22, 1946, Irgun attacked the British administrative headquarters for Palestine, which was housed in the southern wing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem. 91 people of various nationalities were killed and 46 were injured. The hotel was the site of the central offices of the British Mandatory authorities of Palestine, principally the Secretariat of the Government of Palestine and the Headquarters of the British Armed Forces in Palestine and Transjordan. The attack initially had the approval of the Haganah (the principal Jewish paramilitary group in Palestine). It was conceived as a response to Operation Agatha (a series of widespread raids, including one on the Jewish Agency, conducted by the British authorities) and was the deadliest directed at the British during the Mandate era (1920–1948).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Jews did the Third and Fourth Aliyahs bring to Palestine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">100,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Irgun attack the British administrative headquarters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">July 22, 1946</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Jewish population in Palestine by the end of World War II?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">33%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After World War II, Britain found itself in intense conflict with the Jewish community over Jewish immigration limits, as well as continued conflict with the Arab community over limit levels.

The PLO also recognized Israel's right to exist and pledged an end to terrorism. In 1994, the Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace was signed, making Jordan the second Arab country to normalize relations with Israel. Arab public support for the Accords was damaged by the continuation of Israeli settlements and checkpoints, and the deterioration of economic conditions. Israeli public support for the Accords waned as Israel was struck by Palestinian suicide attacks. Finally, while leaving a peace rally in November 1995, Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a far-right-wing Jew who opposed the Accords.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who became the Prime Minister in 1992?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yitzhak Rabin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace signed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1994</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Yitzhak Rabin assassinated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">November 1995</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the end of the 1990s, Israel, under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, withdrew from Hebron, and signed the Wye River Memorandum, giving greater control to the Palestinian National Authority.

During the summit, Barak offered a plan for the establishment of a Palestinian state. The proposed state included the entirety of the Gaza Strip and over 90% of the West Bank with Jerusalem as a shared capital, although some argue that the plan was to annex areas which would lead to a cantonization of the West Bank into three blocs, which the Palestinian delegation likened to South African &quot;bantustans&quot;, a loaded word that was disputed by the Israeli and American negotiators.

Hamas announced its own ceasefire, with its own conditions of complete withdrawal and opening of border crossings. Despite neither the rocket launchings nor Israeli retaliatory strikes having completely stopped, the fragile ceasefire remained in order. In what Israel described as a response to more than a hundred Palestinian rocket attacks on southern Israeli cities, Israel began an operation in Gaza on 14 November 2012, lasting eight days.

With contemporary Jewish culture's strong emphasis, promotion of scholarship and learning and the strong propensity to promote cultivation of intellectual pursuits as well as the nations high university educational attainment rate exemplifies how highly Israeli society values higher education. The Israeli education system has been praised for various reasons, including its high quality and its major role in spurring Israel's economic development and technological boom. Many international business leaders and organizations such as Microsoft founder Bill Gates have praised Israel for its high quality of education in helping spur Israel's economic development. In 2012, the country ranked second among OECD countries (tied with Japan and after Canada) for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 46 percent compared with the OECD average of 32 percent. In addition, nearly twice as many Israelis aged 55–64 held a higher education degree compared to other OECD countries, with 47 percent holding an academic degree compared with the OECD average of 25%. In 2012, the country ranked third in the world in the number of academic degrees per capita (20 percent of the population).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Israel ranked among OECD countries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">second</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did it rank in the number of academic degrees per capita?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">third</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who praised Israel for its high quality education?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bill Gates</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Israel has a school life expectancy of 15.5 years and a literacy rate of 97.1% according to the United Nations. The State Education Law, passed in 1953, established five types of schools: state secular, state religious, ultra orthodox, communal settlement schools, and Arab schools. The public secular is the largest school group, and is attended by the majority of Jewish and non-Arab pupils in Israel. Most Arabs send their children to schools where Arabic is the language of instruction. Education is compulsory in Israel for children between the ages of three and eighteen. Schooling is divided into three tiers – primary school (grades 1–6), middle school (grades 7–9), and high school (grades 10–12) – culminating with Bagrut matriculation exams. Proficiency in core subjects such as mathematics, the Hebrew language, Hebrew and general literature, the English language, history, Biblical scripture and civics is necessary to receive a Bagrut certificate. In Arab, Christian and Druze schools, the exam on Biblical studies is replaced by an exam on Muslim, Christian or Druze heritage. Christian Arabs are one of the most educated groups in Israel. Maariv have describe the Christian Arabs sectors as &quot;the most successful in education system&quot;, since Christian Arabs fared the best in terms of education in comparison to any other group receiving an education in Israel. Israeli children from Russian-speaking families have a higher bagrut pass rate at high-school level. Although amongst immigrant children born in the FSU, the bagrut pass rate is highest amongst those families from Western FSU states of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova (at 62.6%), and lower amongst those from Central Asian and Caucasian FSU states. In 2003, over half of all Israeli twelfth graders earned a matriculation certificate.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the school expectancy in Israel?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15.5 years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the literacy rate in Israel?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">97.1% </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is necessary to receive a Bagrut certificate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Biblical scripture and civics</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Israel has nine public universities that are subsidized by the state and 49 private colleges.

Israel's substantial Arab minority has also left its imprint on Israeli culture in such spheres as architecture, music, and cuisine.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does Israel's diverse culture stem from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">diversity of its population</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Life revolves around what in Israel?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hebrew calendar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Work and school holidays are determined by what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jewish holidays</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Israeli literature is primarily poetry and prose written in Hebrew, as part of the renaissance of Hebrew as a spoken language since the mid-19th century, although a small body of literature is published in other languages, such as English. By law, two copies of all printed matter published in Israel must be deposited in the National Library of Israel at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 2001, the law was amended to include audio and video recordings, and other non-print media. In 2013, 91 percent of the 7,863 books transferred to the library were in Hebrew. The Hebrew Book Week is held each June and features book fairs, public readings, and appearances by Israeli authors around the country.

Kosher restaurants, though rare in the 1960s, make up around 25% of the total as of 2015[update], perhaps reflecting the largely secular values of those who dine out. Hotel restaurants are much more likely to serve kosher food. The non-kosher retail market was traditionally sparse, but grew rapidly and considerably following the influx of immigrants from Eastern Europe and Russia during the 1990s.
