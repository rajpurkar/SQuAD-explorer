Cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized cultural relativism, holism, and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques. This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from Boas' arguments against 19th-century racial ideology, through Margaret Mead's advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of post-colonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism.

Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research, i.e. an ethnographic monograph. As methodology, ethnography is based upon long-term fieldwork within a community or other research site. Participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology. Ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures.

To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities. Boas' Primitive Art, Claude Lévi-Strauss' The Way of the Masks (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally specific 'aesthetics'.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a cultural phenomenon? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">art </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What have several anthropologists noted about Western artistic endeavors and their place in non-Western contexts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">do not exist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What formal features in objects do anthropologists of art focus on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">evident 'aesthetic' qualities</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Art as Cultural System penned?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1983</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">culturally specific 'aesthetics'</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently, such as the use by Étienne Serres in 1838 to describe the natural history, or paleontology, of man, based on comparative anatomy, and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the National Museum of Natural History (France) by Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau.

Sahlins work on Hunter-gatherers as the 'original affluent society' did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam.

Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more &quot;complex&quot; social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena. The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels. First of all, anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization). Second of all, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and of course on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions). An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today. Geertz' comparative work on &quot;Negara&quot;, the Balinese state is an early, famous example.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of anthropology is interested in the structure of political systems?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Political </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what basis do political anthropologists examine the structure of political systems?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">structure of societies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the new development of a stateless society come about?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the 1960s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The presence of states, bureaucracies and markets makes for what type of social setting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;complex&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did a comparative work on a Balinese state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Geertz</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Cyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the American Anthropological Association's annual meeting in 1993.

By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method, a central part of their science.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do anthropologists typically like to divide up the world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">relevant time periods and geographic regions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How has human time on Earth been divided up?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cultural traditions based on material</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Olduwan, Mousterian, and Levalloisian are all types of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tool </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Mapping cultures is central to both the sciences of anthropologists and who else?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">geographers </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a central part of the science of anthropology?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">comparative method</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of &quot;other cultures&quot;, both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-Western societies).
