However, the Philippines, a predominantly Roman Catholic country, does not celebrate Carnival anymore since the dissolution of the Manila Carnival after 1939, the last carnival in the country. In historically Lutheran countries, the celebration is known as Fastelavn, and in areas with a high concentration of Anglicans and Methodists, pre-Lenten celebrations, along with penitential observances, occur on Shrove Tuesday. In Eastern Orthodox nations, Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent. In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands, the Carnival season traditionally opens on 11/11 (often at 11:11 a.m.). This dates back to celebrations before the Advent season or with harvest celebrations of St. Martin's Day.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When does Fastelavn occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Shrove Tuesday</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Philippines stopped celebrating Carnival after what year? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1939</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Maslenitsa is celebrated in what type of nation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eastern Orthodox</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Carnival celebration known as in Lutheran countries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fastelavn</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When does Carnival typically begin in the Netherlands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">on 11/11</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The term Carnival is very common in areas with a large presence of which religious sect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Catholic </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country no longer celebrates Carnival?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Philippines</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Manila Carnival was dissolved after what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1939</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Carnival known as in countries which are mostly Lutheran?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fastelavn</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the festival celebrated in Eastern Orthodox nations during the last week before Great Lent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maslenitsa </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Traditionally a carnival feast was the last opportunity to eat well before the time of food shortage at the end of the winter during which one was limited to the minimum necessary.

The main events typically occur during February or early March, during the period historically known as Shrovetide (or Pre-Lent). Carnival typically involves a public celebration and/or parade combining some elements of a circus, masks and public street party. People wear masks and costumes during many such celebrations, allowing them to lose their everyday individuality and experience a heightened sense of social unity. Excessive consumption of alcohol, meat, and other foods proscribed during Lent is extremely common. Other common features of carnival include mock battles such as food fights; social satire and mockery of authorities; the grotesque body displaying exaggerated features especially large noses, bellies, mouths, and phalli or elements of animal bodies; abusive language and degrading acts; depictions of disease and gleeful death; and a general reversal of everyday rules and norms. </pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What's the name of the Christian festive season that occurs before the season of Lent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Carnival</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When do the main events of the Christian festival occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">February </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the Carnival open to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">public </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do participants of the Carnival experience a heightened sense of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">social unity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is consumed in excessive amounts during Lent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">alcohol</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Tacitus wrote in his Germania: Germania 9.6: Ceterum nec cohibere parietibus deos neque in ullam humani oris speciem adsimulare ex magnitudine caelestium arbitrator – &quot;The Germans, however, do not consider it consistent with the grandeur of celestial beings to confine the gods within walls, or to liken them to the form of any human countenance.&quot; Germania 40: mox vehiculum et vestis et, si credere velis, numen ipsum secreto lacu abluitur – &quot;Afterwards the car, the vestments, and, if you like to believe it, the divinity herself, are purified in a secret lake.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote the Germania?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tacitus </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do the Germans feel it inconsistent to confine gods within?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">walls</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Germans do not liken the gods to whose countenance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">human </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When is the car used in the ritual purified? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Afterwards </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the divinity herself purified? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a secret lake</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Traditionally the feast also applied to sexual desires, which were supposed to be suppressed during the following fasting.

As with many other Christian festivals such as Christmas which was originally a pagan midwinter festival, the Christian church has found it easier to turn the pagan Carnaval in a catholic tradition than to eliminate it.  Unlike today, carnival in the Middle Ages took not just a few days, but it covered almost the entire period between Christmas and the beginning of Lent.

For the start of the Roman Saturnalia, on December 17 authorities chose an enemy of the Roman people to represent the Lord of Misrule in each community.

Many local Carnival customs are claimed to derive from local pre-Christian rituals, such as elaborate rites involving masked figures in the Swabian–Alemannic Fastnacht. However, evidence is insufficient to establish a direct origin from Saturnalia or other ancient festivals. No complete accounts of Saturnalia survive and the shared features of feasting, role reversals, temporary social equality, masks and permitted rule-breaking do not necessarily constitute a coherent festival or link these festivals. These similarities may represent a reservoir of cultural resources that can embody multiple meanings and functions. For example, Easter begins with the resurrection of Jesus, followed by a liminal period and ends with rebirth. Carnival reverses this as King Carnival comes to life, a liminal period follows before his death. Both feasts are calculated by the lunar calendar. Both Jesus and King Carnival may be seen as expiatory figures who make a gift to the people with their deaths. In the case of Jesus, the gift is eternal life in heaven and in the case of King Carnival, the acknowledgement that death is a necessary part of the cycle of life. Besides Christian anti-Judaism, the commonalities between church and Carnival rituals and imagery suggest a common root. Christ's passion is itself grotesque: Since early Christianity Christ is figured as the victim of summary judgement, is tortured and executed by Romans before a Jewish mob (&quot;His blood is on us and on our children!&quot; Matthew 27:24–25). Holy Week processions in Spain include crowds who vociferously insult the figure of Jesus. Irreverence, parody, degradation and laughter at a tragicomic effigy God can be seen as intensifications of the sacred order. In 1466, the Catholic Church under Pope Paul II revieved customs of the Saturnalia carnival: Jews were forced to race naked through the streets of the city of Rome. “Before they were to run, the Jews were richly fed, so as to make the race more difficult for them and at the same time more amusing for spectators. They ran… amid Rome’s taunting shrieks and peals of laughter, while the Holy Father stood upon a richly ornamented balcony and laughed heartily”, an eyewitness reports.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is insufficient to establish a direct origin from ancient festivals to Carnival?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">evidence </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What festival did no complete accounts describing survive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Saturnalia </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do both Jesus and King Carnival make a gift to the people?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">with their deaths</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the gift of King Carnival?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">acknowledgement that death is a necessary part of the cycle of life</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was forced to race naked through the streets of Rom by Pope Paul II?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jews </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some of the best-known traditions, including carnal parades and masquerade balls, were first recorded in medieval Italy. The carnival of Venice was, for a long time, the most famous carnival (although Napoleon abolished it in 1797 and only in 1979 was the tradition restored). From Italy, Carnival traditions spread to Spain, Portugal and France and from France to New France in North America. From Spain and Portugal it spread with colonization to the Caribbean and Latin America. In the early 19th century in the German Rhineland and Southern Netherlands, the weakened medieval tradition also revive. Continuously in the 18th and 19th centuries CE, as part of the annual Saturnalia abuse of the carnival in Rome, rabbis of the ghetto were forced to march through the city streets wearing foolish guise, jeered upon and pelted by a variety of missiles from the crowd. A petition of the Jewish community of Rome sent in 1836 to Pope Gregory XVI to stop the annual anti-semitic Saturnalia abuse got a negation: “It is not opportune to make any innovation.”</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were some of the best-known traditions first recorded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Italy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city's carnival was the most famous for a long time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Venice </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first place in North America with a Carnival tradition?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New France</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were rabbis from the ghettos forced to march through the city streets wearing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> foolish guise</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who dismissed the petition of the Jewish community to stop the abuse of them?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pope Gregory XV</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Carnival was introduced by Portuguese settlers.

It is best known for Les Comparses (held on Sunday), a tumultuous dance in which 12,000 or more dancers organized into rival groups throw 75 tons of hard candies at one other. The women protect their faces with Mantons de Manila (Manila shawls) but eye-patches and slings for broken arms are common the following week. Vilanovins organize an elaborate ritual for the arrival of King Carnival called l'Arrivo that changes every year. It includes a raucous procession of floats and dancers lampooning current events or public figures and a bitingly satiric sermon (el sermo) delivered by the King himself.

Other traditions included climbing a greased pole, feasting and drinking competitions. Originally signaling the end of the yearly cane harvest, it evolved into a national festival.
