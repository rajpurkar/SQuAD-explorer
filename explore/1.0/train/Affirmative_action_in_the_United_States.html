Reports have shown that minorities and women have faced discrimination in schools and businesses for many years and this discrimination produced unfair advantages for whites and males in education and employment. The impetus toward affirmative action is redressing the disadvantages associated with past and present discrimination. Further impetus is a desire to ensure public institutions, such as universities, hospitals, and police forces, are more representative of the populations they serve.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Outside of employment, what is the other main issue that affirmative action focuses on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">education</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Affirmative action attempts to ask institutions to grant extra consideration to what group of people outside of Native Americans and women?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">racial minorities</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Studies showed that discrimination in both business sectors and education resulted in advantages for what group of people?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">whites and males</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Affirmative action does not only attempt to remove disadvantages, but also to ensure what about the number of people in a field?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">are more representative of the populations they serve</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Affirmative action is a subject of controversy. Some policies adopted as affirmative action, such as racial quotas or gender quotas for collegiate admission, have been criticized as a form of reverse discrimination, and such implementation of affirmative action has been ruled unconstitutional by the majority opinion of Gratz v. Bollinger. Affirmative action as a practice was upheld by the Supreme Court's decision in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003. Affirmative action policies were developed in order to correct decades of discrimination stemming from the Reconstruction Era by granting disadvantaged minorities opportunities. Many believe that the diversity of current American society suggests that affirmative action policies succeeded and are no longer required. Opponents of affirmative action argue that these policies are outdated and lead to reverse discrimination which entails favoring one group over another based upon racial preference rather than achievement.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another example aside from racial quotes of affirmative action for collegiate admissions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gender quotas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Having quotas regarding admissions or employment has been criticized and said to be what kind of discrimination?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reverse</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What case determined that some implementation of affirmative action was unconstitutional?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gratz v.

In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the &quot;Forty acres and a mule&quot; policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term &quot;affirmative action&quot; in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors &quot;take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.&quot; This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts. In 1967, the order was amended to include sex as well. The Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246, but these contemplated changes[which?] faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Reconstruction Era end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1877</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who proposed that land be divided and split up among families of color?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">General William Tecumseh Sherman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the policy of dividing land among families of color referred to as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Forty acres and a mule</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which part of the constitution was the basis for policies that were developed during the Civil Rights Movement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first person to utilize the term &quot;affirmative action&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> President John F.

Wagner of New York, the Wagner Act was in line with President Roosevelt's goal of providing economic security to workers and other low-income groups. During this time period it was not uncommon for employers to blacklist or fire employees associated with unions. The Wagner Act allowed workers to unionize without fear of being discriminated against, and empowered a National Labor Relations Board to review potential cases of worker discrimination. In the event of discrimination, employees were to be restored to an appropriate status in the company through 'affirmative action'. While the Wagner Act protected workers and unions it did not protect minorities, who, exempting the Congress of Industrial Organizations, were often barred from union ranks.:11 This original coining of the term therefore has little to do with affirmative action policy as it is seen today, but helped set the stage for all policy meant to compensate or address an individual's unjust treatment.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which document did the term &quot;affirmative action&quot; first appear?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">National Labor Relations Act</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the author of the National Labor Relations Act?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Senator Robert F.

Ickes. Ickes prohibited discrimination in hiring for Public Works Administration funded projects and oversaw not only the institution of a quota system, where contractors were required to employ a fixed percentage of Black workers, by Robert C. Weaver and Clark Foreman,:12 but also the equal pay of women proposed by Harry Hopkins.:14FDR's largest contribution to affirmative action, however, lay in his Executive Order 8802 which prohibited discrimination in the defense industry or government.:22 The executive order promoted the idea that if taxpayer funds were accepted through a government contract, then all taxpayers should have an equal opportunity to work through the contractor.:23–4 To enforce this idea, Roosevelt created the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) with the power to investigate hiring practices by government contractors.:22</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the true backer of the cause of affirmative action?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Harold L.

Hearing of the incident, Truman turned to NAACP leader Walter Francis White and declared, &quot;My God! I had no idea it was as terrible as that. We've got to do something.&quot; In 1947 the committee published its findings, To Secure These Rights. The book was widely read, influential, and considered utopian for the times: &quot;In our land men are equal, but they are free to be different. From these very differences among our people has come the great human and national strength of America.&quot; The report discussed and demonstrated racial discrimination in basic freedoms, education, public facilities, personal safety, and employment opportunities. The committee was disturbed by the state of race relations, and included the evacuation of Americans of Japanese descent during the war &quot;made without a trial or any sort of hearing…Fundamental to our whole system of law is the belief that guilt is personal and not a matter of heredity or association.&quot; The recommendations were radical, calling for federal policies and laws to end racial discrimination and bring about equality: &quot;We can tolerate no restrictions upon the individual which depend upon irrelevant factors such as his race, his color, his religion, or the social position to which he is born.&quot; To Secure These Rights set the liberal legislative agenda for the next generation that eventually would be signed into law by Lyndon B.

Particularly, during World War II, Japanese Americans were interned in camps and lost their property, homes, and businesses. Discrimination against Asians began with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and then continued with the Scott Act of 1888 and the Geary Act of 1892. At the beginning of the 20th century, the United States passed the Immigration Act of 1924 to prevent Asian immigration out of fear that Asians were stealing white jobs and lowering the standard for wages. In addition, whites and non-Asians do not differentiate among the different Asian groups and perpetuate the &quot;model minority&quot; stereotype. According to a 2010 article by Professor Qin Zhang of Fairfield University, Asians are characterized as one dimensional in having great work ethic and valuing education, but lacking in communication skills and personality. A negative outcome of this stereotype is that Asians have been portrayed as having poor leadership and interpersonal skills. This has contributing to the &quot;glass ceiling&quot; phenomenon in which although there are many qualified Asian Americans, they occupy a disproportionately small number of executive positions in businesses.

In his speech, he discussed the history in the United States that brought the policy into fruition: slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation. Clinton also mentioned a point similar to President Lyndon B. Johnson's &quot;Freedom is not Enough&quot; speech, and declared that just outlawing discrimination in the country would not be enough to give everyone in America equality.

Workplace diversity has become a business management concept in which employers actively seek to promote an inclusive workplace. By valuing diversity, employers have the capacity to create an environment in which there is a culture of respect for individual differences as well as the ability to draw in talent and ideas from all segments of the population. By creating this diverse workforce, these employers and companies gain a competitive advantage in an increasingly global economy. According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, many private sector employers have concluded that a diverse workforce makes a &quot;company stronger, more profitable, and a better place to work.&quot; Therefore, these diversity promoting policies are implemented for competitive reasons rather than as a response to discrimination, but have shown the value in having diversity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the National Conference of State Legislatures held in 2014?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Washington D.C.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did proponents of affirmative action claim some of the effects of policies that support affirmative action had done?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">help to open doors for historically excluded groups in workplace settings and higher education</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has the concept of workplace diversity caused employers to do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">actively seek to promote an inclusive workplace</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Having a diverse workplace allows for employers to do what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">draw in talent and ideas from all segments of the population</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which organization claims that private sector employers believe having a diverse workplace is beneficial?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the year 2000, according to a study by American Association of University Professors (AAUP), affirmative action promoted diversity within colleges and universities. This has been shown to have positive effects on the educational outcomes and experiences of college students as well as the teaching of faculty members. According to a study by Geoffrey Maruyama and José F. Moreno, the results showed that faculty members believed diversity helps students to reach the essential goals of a college education, Caucasian students suffer no detrimental effects from classroom diversity, and that attention to multicultural learning improves the ability of colleges and universities to accomplish their missions. Furthermore, a diverse population of students offers unique perspectives in order to challenge preconceived notions through exposure to the experiences and ideas of others. According to Professor Gurin of the University of Michigan, skills such as &quot;perspective-taking, acceptance of differences, a willingness and capacity to find commonalities among differences, acceptance of conflict as normal, conflict resolution, participation in democracy, and interest in the wider social world&quot; can potentially be developed in college while being exposed to heterogeneous group of students. In addition, broadening perspectives helps students confront personal and substantive stereotypes and fosters discussion about racial and ethnic issues in a classroom setting. Furthermore, the 2000 AAUP study states that having a diversity of views leads to a better discussion and greater understanding among the students on issues of race, tolerance, fairness, etc.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does AAUP stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">American Association of University Professors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the effects of affirmative action on universities according to the study done by the AAUP?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">positive effects on the educational outcomes and experiences of college students</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did a study claim about the beliefs of faculty members on increased diversity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">helps students to reach the essential goals of a college education</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who supposedly suffers no detrimental effects from classroom diversity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Caucasian students</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which year did the AAUP release their study?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Richard Sander claims that by artificially elevating minority students into schools they otherwise would not be capable of attending, this discourages them and tends to engender failure and high dropout rates for these students.

He claims that the supposed &quot;beneficiaries&quot; of affirmative action – minorities – do not actually benefit and rather are harmed by the policy. Sander's claims have been disputed, and his empirical analyses have been subject to substantial criticism.

People like Ward Connerly assert that affirmative action requires the very discrimination it is seeking to eliminate. According to these opponents, this contradiction might make affirmative action counter-productive. One argument for reverse discrimination is the idea that affirmative action encourages mediocrity and incompetence. Job positions would not be offered to the applicants who are the most qualified, but to applicants with a special trait such as a certain race, ethnicity, or gender. For example, opponents say affirmative action causes unprepared applicants to be accepted in highly demanding educational institutions or jobs which result in eventual failure (see, for example, Richard Sander's study of affirmative action in Law School, bar exam and eventual performance at law firms). Other opponents say that affirmative action lowers the bar and so denies those who strive for excellence on their own merit and the sense of real achievement. Opponents of affirmative action suggest that merit should be the primary factor considered in applying for job positions, college, graduate school, etc.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a definition of reverse discrimination?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a policy or practice in which members of a majority are discriminated against in favor of a historically disadvantaged group or minority</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do some commentators claim the irony of policies resulting from affirmative action is?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> these policies are just another form of discrimination</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is an example of someone that states that affirmative action is another form of discrimination?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ward Connerly</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the opposition of affirmative action believe should be the main key in determining acceptance in employment or education?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">merit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">An argument against affirmative action is that it encourages what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mediocrity and incompetence</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Another popular argument for affirmative action is the compensation argument.

Michigan joined California, Florida, Texas, and Washington in banning the use of race or sex in admissions considerations.

Scholars such as Ronald Dworkin have asserted that no college applicant has a right to expect that a university will design its admissions policies in a way that prizes any particular set of qualities. In this view, admission is not an honor bestowed to reward superior merit but rather a way to advance the mission as each university defines it. If diversity is a goal of the university and their racial preferences do not discriminate against applicants based on hatred or contempt, then affirmative action can be judged acceptable based on the criteria related to the mission the university sets for itself.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the racial preferences debate indicate about universities and colleges?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">competing notions of the mission of colleges</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What claim did Ronald Dworkin make about the expectations that a college application should not have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a right to expect that a university will design its admissions policies in a way that prizes any particular set of qualities</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Ronald Dworkin believe admission should represent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a way to advance the mission as each university defines it</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When can affirmative action be judged to be acceptable in terms of admissions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">If diversity is a goal of the university and their racial preferences do not discriminate</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>To accommodate the ruling in Hopwood v. Texas banning any use of race in school admissions, the State of Texas passed a law guaranteeing entry to any state university if a student finished in the top 10% of their graduating class. Florida and California have also replaced racial quotas with class rank and other criteria. Class rank tends to benefit top students at less competitive high schools, to the detriment of students at more competitive high schools. This effect, however, may be intentional since less-funded, less competitive schools are more likely to be schools where minority enrollment is high. Critics argue that class rank is more a measure of one's peers than of one's self. The top 10% rule adds racial diversity only because schools are still highly racially segregated because of residential patterns. The class rank rule has the same consequence as traditional affirmative action: opening schools to students who would otherwise not be admitted had the given school used a holistic, merit-based approach. From 1996 to 1998, Texas had merit-based admission to its state universities, and minority enrollment dropped. The state's adoption of the &quot;top 10 percent&quot; rule returned minority enrollment to pre-1996 levels.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the ruling in Hopwood v Texas set a precedent for in terms of admission policies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">banning any use of race in school admissions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the law passed by the State of Texas guarantee?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">entry to any state university if a student finished in the top 10% of their graduating class</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Other than Texas and Florida, which other state replaced racial quotas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">California</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one example of what racial quotas were replaced with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">class rank</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After the state passed the top 10% rule, what happened to minority enrollment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">returned minority enrollment to pre-1996 levels</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During a panel discussion at Harvard University's reunion for African American alumni during the 2003–04 academic year, two prominent black professors at the institution—Lani Guinier and Henry Louis Gates—pointed out an unintended effect of affirmative action policies at Harvard.

The majority of black students at Harvard were Caribbean and African immigrants or their children, with some others the mixed-race children of biracial couples. One Harvard student, born in the South Bronx to a black family whose ancestors have been in the United States for multiple generations, said that there were so few Harvard students from the historic African American community that they took to calling themselves &quot;the descendants&quot; (i.e., descendants of American slaves).

Sander published an article in the November 2004 issue of the Stanford Law Review that questioned the effectiveness of racial preferences in law schools. He noted that, prior to his article, there had been no comprehensive study on the effects of affirmative action. The article presents a study that shows that half of all black law students rank near the bottom of their class after the first year of law school and that black law students are more likely to drop out of law school and to fail the bar exam. The article offers a tentative estimate that the production of new black lawyers in the United States would grow by eight percent if affirmative action programs at all law schools were ended. Less qualified black students would attend less prestigious schools where they would be more closely matched in abilities with their classmates and thus perform relatively better. Sander helped to develop a socioeconomically-based affirmative action plan for the UCLA School of Law after the passage of Proposition 209 in 1996, which prohibited the use of racial preferences by public universities in California. This change occurred after studies showed that the graduation rate of blacks at UCLA was 41%, compared to 73% for whites.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To which university does Richard H.

The University of Texas employs the &quot;Top Ten Percent Law&quot;, under which admission to any public college or university in Texas is guaranteed to high school students who graduate in the top ten percent of their high school class. Fisher has brought the admissions policy to court because she believes that she was denied acceptance to the University of Texas based on her race, and thus, her right to equal protection according to the 14th Amendment was violated. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Fisher on October 10, 2012, and rendered an ambiguous ruling in 2013 that sent the case back to the lower court, stipulating only that the University must demonstrate that it could not achieve diversity through other, non-race sensitive means. In July 2014, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that U of T maintained a &quot;holistic&quot; approach in its application of affirmative action, and could continue the practice. On February 10, 2015, lawyers for Fisher filed a new case in the Supreme Court. It is a renewed complaint that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit got the issue wrong — on the second try as well as on the first. The Supreme Court agreed in June 2015 to hear the case a second time. It will likely be decided by June 2016.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which University had a lawsuit filed against it?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">University of Texas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the plaintiffs claim the university had for an admissions policy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">race-conscious policy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the admissions policy of the University of Texas supposedly violate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">their civil and constitutional rights</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who concluded that the University maintained a &quot;holistic&quot; approach to affirmative action?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When will the Supreme Court likely hear the case for the second time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> June 2016</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On November 17, 2014, Students for Fair Admissions, an offshoot of the Project on Fair Representation, filed lawsuits in federal district court challenging the admissions practices of Harvard University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
