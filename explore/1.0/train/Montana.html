The state's name is derived from the Spanish word montaña (mountain). Montana has several nicknames, although none official, including &quot;Big Sky Country&quot; and &quot;The Treasure State&quot;, and slogans that include &quot;Land of the Shining Mountains&quot; and more recently &quot;The Last Best Place&quot;. Montana is ranked 4th in size, but 44th in population and 48th in population density of the 50 United States. The western third of Montana contains numerous mountain ranges. Smaller island ranges are found throughout the state. In total, 77 named ranges are part of the Rocky Mountains.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does the state's name come from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Spanish word montaña (mountain)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the states rank in size?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">4th</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is its rank in popularion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">44th</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many ranges are part of the Rocky Mountains?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">77</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does the state's name come from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">from the Spanish word montaña</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Montana schoolchildren played a significant role in selecting several state symbols. The state tree, the ponderosa pine, was selected by Montana schoolchildren as the preferred state tree by an overwhelming majority in a referendum held in 1908. However, the legislature did not designate a state tree until 1949, when the Montana Federation of Garden Clubs, with the support of the state forester, lobbied for formal recognition. Schoolchildren also chose the western meadowlark as the state bird, in a 1930 vote, and the legislature acted to endorse this decision in 1931. Similarly, the secretary of state sponsored a children's vote in 1981 to choose a state animal, and after 74 animals were nominated, the grizzly bear won over the elk by a 2–1 margin. The students of Livingston started a statewide school petition drive plus lobbied the governor and the state legislature to name the Maiasaura as the state fossil in 1985.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the state tree selected?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1908</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the state tree actually assigned?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1949</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the state animal selected?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1981</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the state animal of Montana?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">grizzly bear</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the state fossil</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maiasaura </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The state song was not composed until 21 years after statehood, when a musical troupe led by Joseph E. Howard stopped in Butte in September 1910. A former member of the troupe who lived in Butte buttonholed Howard at an after-show party, asking him to compose a song about Montana and got another partygoer, the city editor for the Butte Miner newspaper, Charles C. Cohan, to help. The two men worked up a basic melody and lyrics in about a half-hour for the entertainment of party guests, then finished the song later that evening, with an arrangement worked up the following day. Upon arriving in Helena, Howard's troupe performed 12 encores of the new song to an enthusiastic audience and the governor proclaimed it the state song on the spot, though formal legislative recognition did not occur until 1945. Montana is one of only three states to have a &quot;state ballad&quot;, &quot;Montana Melody&quot;, chosen by the legislature in 1983.

A state seal with a miner's pick and shovel above the motto, surrounded by the mountains and the Great Falls of the Missouri River, was adopted during the first meeting of the territorial legislature in 1864–65. The design was only slightly modified after Montana became a state and adopted it as the Great Seal of the State of Montana, enacted by the legislature in 1893. The state flower, the bitterroot, was adopted in 1895 with the support of a group called the Floral Emblem Association, which formed after Montana's Women's Christian Temperance Union adopted the bitterroot as the organization's state flower. All other symbols were adopted throughout the 20th century, save for Montana's newest symbol, the state butterfly, the mourning cloak, adopted in 2001, and the state lullaby, &quot;Montana Lullaby&quot;, adopted in 2007.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Montana's motto? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oro y Plata</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Montana's motto mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Gold and Silver&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the motto adopted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1865</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">WHen was the state flower adopted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1895 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the state flower for Montana?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bitterroot </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The state also has five Micropolitan Statistical Areas centered on Bozeman, Butte, Helena, Kalispell and Havre.

Montaña del Norte was the name given by early Spanish explorers to the entire mountainous region of the west. The name Montana was added to a bill by the United States House Committee on Territories, which was chaired at the time by Rep. James Ashley of Ohio, for the territory that would become Idaho Territory. The name was successfully changed by Representatives Henry Wilson (Massachusetts) and Benjamin F. Harding (Oregon), who complained that Montana had &quot;no meaning&quot;. When Ashley presented a bill to establish a temporary government in 1864 for a new territory to be carved out of Idaho, he again chose Montana Territory. This time Rep. Samuel Cox, also of Ohio, objected to the name. Cox complained that the name was a misnomer given that most of the territory was not mountainous and that a Native American name would be more appropriate than a Spanish one. Other names such as Shoshone were suggested, but it was eventually decided that the Committee on Territories could name it whatever they wanted, so the original name of Montana was adopted.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does the state's name mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;mountain&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Spanish call this region?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Montaña del Norte </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With a total area of 147,040 square miles (380,800 km2), Montana is slightly larger than Japan.

Schools started forming in the area before it was officially a territory as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Montana Territory formed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 26, 1864</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the first formal school on record?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1862</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much were students charged per week?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$1.75</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the first public school in Virginia City formed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1886</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Montana contains thousands of named rivers and creeks, 450 miles (720 km) of which are known for &quot;blue-ribbon&quot; trout fishing.

These clashes, in part, contributed to the Panic of 1873 which delayed construction of the railroad into Montana. Surveys in 1874, 1875 and 1876 helped spark the Great Sioux War of 1876.

For political reasons, Congress did not approve Montana statehood until 1889. Congress approved Montana statehood in February 1889 and President Grover Cleveland signed an omnibus bill granting statehood to Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Washington once the appropriate state constitutions were crafted. In July 1889, Montanans convened their third constitutional convention and produced a constitution acceptable by the people and the federal government. On November 8, 1889 President Benjamin Harrison proclaimed Montana the forty-first state in the union. The first state governor was Joseph K. Toole.

In 1909, Congress passed the Enlarged Homestead Act that expanded the amount of free land from 160 to 320 acres (0.6 to 1.3 km2) per family and in 1912 reduced the time to &quot;prove up&quot; on a claim to three years. In 1916, the Stock-Raising Homestead Act allowed homesteads of 640 acres in areas unsuitable for irrigation.  This combination of advertising and changes in the Homestead Act drew tens of thousands of homesteaders, lured by free land, with World War I bringing particularly high wheat prices. In addition, Montana was going through a temporary period of higher-than-average precipitation. Homesteaders arriving in this period were known as &quot;Honyockers&quot;, or &quot;scissorbills.&quot; Though the word &quot;honyocker&quot;, possibly derived from the ethnic slur &quot;hunyak,&quot; was applied in a derisive manner at homesteaders as being &quot;greenhorns&quot;, &quot;new at his business&quot; or &quot;unprepared&quot;, the reality was that a majority of these new settlers had previous farming experience, though there were also many who did not.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who promoted settlement in Montana in the early 1900s</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">James J.
