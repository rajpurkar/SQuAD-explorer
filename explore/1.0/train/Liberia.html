Between January 7, 1822 and the American Civil War, more than 15,000 freed and free-born Black Americans from United States and 3,198 Afro-Caribbeans relocated to the settlement. The Black American settlers carried their culture with them to Liberia. The Liberian constitution and flag were modeled after the United States. In January 3, 1848 Joseph Jenkins Roberts, a wealthy free-born Black American from Virginia who settled in Liberia, was elected as Liberia's first president after the people proclaimed independence.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the republic of liberia begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">as a settlement of the American Colonization Society (ACS)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Republic of Liberia declare it's independence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">July 26, 1847</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the united states recognize the republic of Liberia's independence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">February 5, 1862.

Shortly after the Mane conquered the region, the Vai people of the former Mali Empire immigrated into the Grand Cape Mount region.

The American Colonization Society was founded in 1816 in Washington, DC for this purpose, by a group of prominent politicians and slaveholders. But its membership grew to include mostly people who supported abolition of slavery. Slaveholders wanted to get free people of color out of the South, where they were thought to threaten the stability of the slave societies. Some abolitionists collaborated on relocation of free blacks, as they were discouraged by discrimination against them in the North and believed they would never be accepted in the larger society. Most African Americans, who were native-born by this time, wanted to improve conditions in the United States rather than emigrate. Leading activists in the North strongly opposed the ACS, but some free blacks were ready to try a different environment.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is &quot;the american colonization society&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> a movement to resettle American free blacks and freed slaves in Africa.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the &quot;american colonization society founded&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1816 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The &quot;american colonization society&quot; consisted mostly of whom&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> people who supported abolition of slavery</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did slave holders want to do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to get free people of color out of the South</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">rather than emigrate African Americans wanted to do what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">improve conditions in the United States</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1822, the American Colonization Society began sending African-American volunteers to the Pepper Coast to establish a colony for freed African Americans. By 1867, the ACS (and state-related chapters) had assisted in the migration of more than 13,000 African Americans to Liberia. These free African Americans and their descendants married within their community and came to identify as Americo-Liberians. Many were of mixed race and educated in American culture; they did not identify with the indigenous natives of the tribes they encountered. They intermarried largely within the colonial community, developing an ethnic group that had a cultural tradition infused with American notions of political republicanism and Protestant Christianity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">African  Americans were sent to the pepper coast to do what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">establish a colony for freed African Americans.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By 1837 the ACS had assisted in moving how many african americans to liberia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">13,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did African Americans who were moved to Liberia identify as? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Americo-Liberians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Americo-Liberians not identify with? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">indigenous natives of the tribes they encountered</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did African Americans moved to Liberia keep from America?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cultural tradition</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Americo-Liberian settlers did not identify with the indigenous peoples they encountered, especially those in communities of the more isolated &quot;bush.&quot; They knew nothing of their cultures, languages or animist religion. Encounters with tribal Africans in the bush often developed as violent confrontations. The colonial settlements were raided by the Kru and Grebo people from their inland chiefdoms. Because of feeling set apart and superior by their culture and education to the indigenous peoples, the Americo-Liberians developed as a small elite that held on to political power. It excluded the indigenous tribesmen from birthright citizenship in their own lands until 1904, in a repetition of the United States' treatment of Native Americans. Because of the cultural gap between the groups and assumption of superiority of western culture, the Americo-Liberians envisioned creating a western-style state to which the tribesmen should assimilate.
