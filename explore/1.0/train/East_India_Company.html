A Second Opium War fought by Britain and France against China lasted from 1856 until 1860 and led to the Treaty of Tientsin, which legalised the importation of opium.

The existing Brunswick Dock, part of the Blackwall Yard site, became the Export Dock; while a new Import Dock was built to the north. In 1838 the East India Dock Company merged with the West India Dock Company. The docks were taken over by the Port of London Authority in 1909, and closed in 1967.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">in 1803 was act of parliament supported by  EIC? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">promoted by the East India Company</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">the 1803 act created what dock program?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">East India Dock Company</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The goal of the East in dock company was  first what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> aim of establishing a new set of docks (the East India Docks) primarily for the use of ships trading with Indi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the export dock of the EIC after the 1803 act?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brunswick Dock</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">in 1838 what company did the  East india dock company merge with? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">West India Dock Company</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>From the period of 1600, the canton consisted of a St George's Cross representing the Kingdom of England.

On this occasion the Indiamen also succeeded in bluffing their way to safety, and without any shots even being fired.
