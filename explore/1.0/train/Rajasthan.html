It is located on the western side of the country, where it comprises most of the wide and inhospitable Thar Desert (also known as the &quot;Rajasthan Desert&quot; and &quot;Great Indian Desert&quot;) and shares a border with the Pakistani provinces of Punjab to the northwest and Sindh to the west, along the Sutlej-Indus river valley. Elsewhere it is bordered by the other Indian states: Punjab to the north; Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to the northeast; Madhya Pradesh to the southeast; and Gujarat to the southwest. Its features include the ruins of the Indus Valley Civilization at Kalibanga; the Dilwara Temples, a Jain pilgrimage site at Rajasthan's only hill station, Mount Abu, in the ancient Aravalli mountain range; and, in eastern Rajasthan, the Keoladeo National Park near Bharatpur, a World Heritage Site known for its bird life. Rajasthan is also home to two national tiger reserves, the Ranthambore National Park in Sawai Madhopur and Sariska Tiger Reserve in Alwar.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many square kilometers is Rajasthan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">342,239</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of India's total area is Rajasthan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10.4%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are alternative names the Thar Desert is known by?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the &quot;Rajasthan Desert&quot; and &quot;Great Indian Desert&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What province in Pakistan does Rajasthan border on its north?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Punjab</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Dilwara Temples are a pilgrimage site for whom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jain</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first mention of the name &quot;Rajasthan&quot; appears in James Tod's 1829 publication Annals and Antiquities of Rajast'han or the Central and Western Rajpoot States of India, while the earliest known record of &quot;Rajputana&quot; as a name for the region is in George Thomas's 1800 memoir Military Memories.

Kalibangan, in Hanumangarh district, was a major provincial capital of the Indus Valley Civilization,. It is believed that Western Kshatrapas (405–35 BC) were Saka rulers of the western part of India (Saurashtra and Malwa: modern Gujarat, Southern Sindh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan). They were successors to the Indo-Scythians and were contemporaneous with the Kushans, who ruled the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. The Indo-Scythians invaded the area of Ujjain and established the Saka era (with their calendar), marking the beginning of the long-lived Saka Western Satraps state. Matsya, a state of the Vedic civilisation of India, is said to roughly corresponded to the former state of Jaipur in Rajasthan and included the whole of Alwar with portions of Bharatpur. The capital of Matsya was at Viratanagar (modern Bairat), which is said to have been named after its founder king Virata.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Some portions of Rajasthan were involved with what ancient civilization?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Indus Valley Civilization</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what Indus Valley Civilization district was Kalibangan within?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hanumangarh district</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the Saka Rulers of Western India believed to be called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Western Kshatrapas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Over what time period were the Western Kshatrapas in power?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">405–35 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Kushans ruled what part of the Indian subcontinent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the northern part</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Traditionally the Rajputs, Jats, Meenas, Gurjars, Bhils, Rajpurohit, Charans, Yadavs, Bishnois, Sermals, PhulMali (Saini) and other tribes made a great contribution in building the state of Rajasthan.

Majumdar says that this was openly acknowledged by the Arab writers. He further notes that historians of India have wondered at the slow progress of Muslim invaders in India, as compared with their rapid advance in other parts of the world. Now there seems little doubt that it was the power of the Gurjara Pratihara army that effectively barred the progress of the Arabs beyond the confines of Sindh, their first conquest for nearly 300 years.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What empire stopped Arab invasions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gurjar Pratihar Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Arab attempted to invade the Gurjar Pratihar Empire beginning in what century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">8th</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Arab conquest was limited to what region?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sindh</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the most notable accomplishment of the Gurjara Pratihara Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">its successful resistance to foreign invasions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which historian claims that even the Arabs acknowledged the importance of the Gurjara Pratihara Empire in stopping invasions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Historian R.

Marwar (Jodhpur), Bikaner, Mewar (Chittorgarh), Alwar and Dhundhar (Jaipur) were some of the main Rajput princely states. Bharatpur and Dholpur were Jat princely states whereas Tonk was a princely state under a Muslim Nawab. Rajput families rose to prominence in the 6th century CE. The Rajputs put up a valiant resistance to the Islamic invasions and protected this land with their warfare and chivalry for more than 500 years. They also resisted Mughal incursions into India and thus contributed to their slower-than-anticipated access to the Indian subcontinent. Later, the Mughals, through skilled warfare, were able to get a firm grip on northern India, including Rajasthan. Mewar led other kingdoms in its resistance to outside rule. Most notably, Rana Sanga fought the Battle of Khanua against Babur, the founder of the Mughal empire.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many princely states of Rajputana contain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nineteen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the British district within Rajputana?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ajmer-Merwara</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Bharatpur is an example of what kind of state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">princely</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Under a Muslim Nawab there was a princely state, what was its name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tonk</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What families rose to power in the 6th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rajput families</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Over the years, the Mughals began to have internal disputes which greatly distracted them at times.

Most of this region are covered by the Thar Desert which extends into adjoining portions of Pakistan. The Aravalli Range does not intercept the moisture-giving southwest monsoon winds off the Arabian Sea, as it lies in a direction parallel to that of the coming monsoon winds, leaving the northwestern region in a rain shadow. The Thar Desert is thinly populated; the town of Jodhpur is the largest city in the desert and known as the gateway of thar desert. The desert has some major districts like Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner and Nagour. This area is also important defence point of view. Jodhpur airbase is Indias largest airbase and military, BSF bases are also situated here. A single civil airport is also situated in Jodhpur. The Northwestern thorn scrub forests lie in a band around the Thar Desert, between the desert and the Aravallis. This region receives less than 400 mm of rain in an average year. Temperatures can exceed 48 °C in the summer months and drop below freezing in the winter. The Godwar, Marwar, and Shekhawati regions lie in the thorn scrub forest zone, along with the city of Jodhpur. The Luni River and its tributaries are the major river system of Godwar and Marwar regions, draining the western slopes of the Aravallis and emptying southwest into the great Rann of Kutch wetland in neighboring Gujarat. This river is saline in the lower reaches and remains potable only up to Balotara in Barmer district. The Ghaggar River, which originates in Haryana, is an intermittent stream that disappears into the sands of the Thar Desert in the northern corner of the state and is seen as a remnant of the primitive Saraswati river.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Dry and sandy conditions are indicative of which region of Rajasthan? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The northwestern portion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which desert is in the northwestern part of Rajasthan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Thar Desert</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most populous city in the Thar Desert?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jodhpur</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the names of the major districts of the Thar?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner and Nagour</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Rainfall in the Thar Desert region is less than what amount each year on avarage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">400 mm</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Aravalli Range and the lands to the east and southeast of the range are generally more fertile and better watered.
