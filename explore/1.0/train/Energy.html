The &quot;ability of a system to perform work&quot; is a common description, but it is difficult to give one single comprehensive definition of energy because of its many forms. For instance, in SI units, energy is measured in joules, and one joule is defined &quot;mechanically&quot;, being the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.[note 1] However, there are many other definitions of energy, depending on the context, such as thermal energy, radiant energy, electromagnetic, nuclear, etc., where definitions are derived that are the most convenient.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a property of objects which can be transferred to other objects or converted into different forms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">energy </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In SI units, energy is measured in what measurement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">joules</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Mechanically, one joule is defined as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Common energy forms include the kinetic energy of a moving object, the potential energy stored by an object's position in a force field (gravitational, electric or magnetic), the elastic energy stored by stretching solid objects, the chemical energy released when a fuel burns, the radiant energy carried by light, and the thermal energy due to an object's temperature. All of the many forms of energy are convertible to other kinds of energy.

While heat can always be fully converted into work in a reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, for cyclic processes of practical interest in heat engines the second law of thermodynamics states that the system doing work always loses some energy as waste heat. This creates a limit to the amount of heat energy that can do work in a cyclic process, a limit called the available energy.

Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structure, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of the substances involved. Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants. A reaction is said to be exergonic if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the case of endergonic reactions the situation is the reverse. Chemical reactions are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the activation energy. The speed of a chemical reaction (at given temperature T) is related to the activation energy E, by the Boltzmann's population factor e−E/kT – that is the probability of molecule to have energy greater than or equal to E at the given temperature T.

Within an organism it is responsible for growth and development of a biological cell or an organelle of a biological organism. Energy is thus often said to be stored by cells in the structures of molecules of substances such as carbohydrates (including sugars), lipids, and proteins, which release energy when reacted with oxygen in respiration. In human terms, the human equivalent (H-e) (Human energy conversion) indicates, for a given amount of energy expenditure, the relative quantity of energy needed for human metabolism, assuming an average human energy expenditure of 12,500 kJ per day and a basal metabolic rate of 80 watts. For example, if our bodies run (on average) at 80 watts, then a light bulb running at 100 watts is running at 1.25 human equivalents (100 ÷ 80) i.e. 1.25 H-e. For a difficult task of only a few seconds' duration, a person can put out thousands of watts, many times the 746 watts in one official horsepower. For tasks lasting a few minutes, a fit human can generate perhaps 1,000 watts. For an activity that must be sustained for an hour, output drops to around 300; for an activity kept up all day, 150 watts is about the maximum.

The conversion of a portion of the chemical energy to heat at each step in a metabolic pathway is the physical reason behind the pyramid of biomass observed in ecology: to take just the first step in the food chain, of the estimated 124.7 Pg/a of carbon that is fixed by photosynthesis, 64.3 Pg/a (52%) are used for the metabolism of green plants, i.e. reconverted into carbon dioxide and heat.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What states that energy tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The second law of thermodynamics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are remarkably inefficient in their use of the energy they receive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> living organisms </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Complex organisms can occupy this, that are not available to their simpler brethern?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ecological niches</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Sunlight may be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes the Earth, as (for example) water evaporates from oceans and is deposited upon mountains (where, after being released at a hydroelectric dam, it can be used to drive turbines or generators to produce electricity).

The nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the Sun also releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the Big Bang. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This meant that hydrogen represents a store of potential energy that can be released by fusion.

The solution of this equation for a bound system is discrete (a set of permitted states, each characterized by an energy level) which results in the concept of quanta.

This mathematical result is called the second law of thermodynamics.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the principle that is vitally important to understanding the behaviour of a quantity closely related to energy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">entropy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is entropy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> measure of evenness of a distribution of energy between parts of a system</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the mathematical result when an isolated system is given more degrees of freedom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">second law of thermodynamics</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
