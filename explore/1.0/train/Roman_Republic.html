It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. During the first two centuries of its existence, the Roman Republic expanded through a combination of conquest and alliance, from central Italy to the entire Italian peninsula. By the following century, it included North Africa, Spain, and what is now southern France. Two centuries after that, towards the end of the 1st century BC, it included the rest of modern France, Greece, and much of the eastern Mediterranean. By this time, internal tensions led to a series of civil wars, culminating with the assassination of Julius Caesar, which led to the transition from republic to empire. The exact date of transition can be a matter of interpretation. Historians have variously proposed Julius Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon River in 49 BC, Caesar's appointment as dictator for life in 44 BC, and the defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. However, most use the same date as did the ancient Romans themselves, the Roman Senate's grant of extraordinary powers to Octavian and his adopting the title Augustus in 27 BC, as the defining event ending the Republic.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Roman Republic begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">509 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Roman Republic end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">27 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What marked the beginning of the Roman Republic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Cleopatra defeated at the Battle of Actium?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">31 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do most consider to be the event that ended the Roman Republic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Roman Senate's grant of extraordinary powers to Octavian</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Roman government was headed by two consuls, elected annually by the citizens and advised by a senate composed of appointed magistrates. As Roman society was very hierarchical by modern standards, the evolution of the Roman government was heavily influenced by the struggle between the patricians, Rome's land-holding aristocracy, who traced their ancestry to the founding of Rome, and the plebeians, the far more numerous citizen-commoners. Over time, the laws that gave patricians exclusive rights to Rome's highest offices were repealed or weakened, and leading plebeian families became full members of the aristocracy. The leaders of the Republic developed a strong tradition and morality requiring public service and patronage in peace and war, making military and political success inextricably linked. Many of Rome's legal and legislative structures (later codified into the Justinian Code, and again into the Napoleonic Code) can still be observed throughout Europe and much of the world in modern nation states and international organizations.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who elected consuls in the Roman government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">citizens</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who eventually became full members of the aristocracy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">leading plebeian families</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were Rome's legislative structures eventually turned into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Justinian Code</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the senate that advised consuls in the Roman government comprised of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">appointed magistrates</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What went hand and hand with military success?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">political success</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The exact causes and motivations for Rome's military conflicts and expansions during the republic are subject to wide debate. While they can be seen as motivated by outright aggression and imperialism, historians typically take a much more nuanced view. They argue that Rome's expansion was driven by short-term defensive and inter-state factors (that is, relations with city-states and kingdoms outside Rome's hegemony), and the new contingencies that these decisions created. In its early history, as Rome successfully defended itself against foreign threats in central and then northern Italy, neighboring city-states sought the protection a Roman alliance would bring. As such, early republican Rome was not an &quot;empire&quot; or &quot;state&quot; in the modern sense, but an alliance of independent city-states (similar to the Greek hegemonies of the same period) with varying degrees of genuine independence (which itself changed over time) engaged in an alliance of mutual self-protection, but led by Rome. With some important exceptions, successful wars in early republican Rome generally led not to annexation or military occupation, but to the restoration of the way things were. But the defeated city would be weakened (sometimes with outright land concessions) and thus less able to resist Romanizing influences, such as Roman settlers seeking land or trade with the growing Roman confederacy. It was also less able to defend itself against its non-Roman enemies, which made attack by these enemies more likely. It was, therefore, more likely to seek an alliance of protection with Rome.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What factor is considered by some to be the main driving force behind the expansion of Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">inter-state factors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of policy is considered by some to be responsible for Rome's many military conflicts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">imperialism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a common conclusion to wars in the early days of republican Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">restoration of the way things were</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of alliance was created between the various Roman city-states?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mutual self-protection</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Roman settlers commonly seek out?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">land</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>This growing coalition expanded the potential enemies that Rome might face, and moved Rome closer to confrontation with major powers. The result was more alliance-seeking, on the part of both the Roman confederacy and city-states seeking membership (and protection) within that confederacy. While there were exceptions to this (such as military rule of Sicily after the First Punic War), it was not until after the Second Punic War that these alliances started to harden into something more like an empire, at least in certain locations. This shift mainly took place in parts of the west, such as the southern Italian towns that sided with Hannibal.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After what war did the alliances start to solidify?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Second Punic War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What helped Rome move closer to a confrontation with several other major powers in the area?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">This growing coalition</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What towns had chosen Hannibal's side?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">southern Italian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did city-states hope to gain from the Roman confederacy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">membership (and protection)</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In contrast, Roman expansion into Spain and Gaul occurred as a mix of alliance-seeking and military occupation. In the 2nd century BC, Roman involvement in the Greek east remained a matter of alliance-seeking, but this time in the face of major powers that could rival Rome. According to Polybius, who sought to trace how Rome came to dominate the Greek east in less than a century, this was mainly a matter of several Greek city-states seeking Roman protection against the Macedonian kingdom and Seleucid Empire in the face of destabilisation created by the weakening of Ptolemaic Egypt. In contrast to the west, the Greek east had been dominated by major empires for centuries, and Roman influence and alliance-seeking led to wars with these empires that further weakened them and therefore created an unstable power vacuum that only Rome could fill. This had some important similarities to (and important differences from) the events in Italy centuries earlier, but this time on a global scale.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What effect did the weakening of Ptolemaic Egypt have on nearby areas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">destabilisation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who attempted to find out how Rome dominated the Greek east?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Polybius</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was Rome involved in matters in the Greek east?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">alliance-seeking</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which countries citie-states attempted to gain the protection of Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greek</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Historians see the growing Roman influence over the east, as with the west, as not a matter of intentional empire-building, but constant crisis management narrowly focused on short-term goals within a highly unstable, unpredictable, and inter-dependent network of alliances and dependencies.

One by one Rome defeated both the persistent Sabines and the local cities, both those under Etruscan control and those that had cast off their Etruscan rulers. Rome defeated Latin cities in the Battle of Lake Regillus in 496 BC, the Battle of Mons Algidus in 458 BC, the Battle of Corbione in 446 BC, the Battle of Aricia, and especially the Battle of the Cremera in 477 BC wherein it fought against the most important Etruscan city of Veii.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what battle did Rome claim victory over several Latin cities in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Battle of Lake Regillus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Battle of Lake Regillus take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">496 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Rome claim victory against the city of Veii?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">477 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Roman battle took place in the year 446 BC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Battle of Corbione</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who initially had control over the Sabines?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Etruscan control</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>By 390 BC, several Gallic tribes were invading Italy from the north as their culture expanded throughout Europe.

These towns, overwhelmed by the enemy's numbers and ferocity, called on Rome for help. The Romans met the Gauls in pitched battle at the Battle of Allia River around 390–387 BC. The Gauls, led by chieftain Brennus, defeated the Roman army of approximately 15,000 troops, pursued the fleeing Romans back to Rome, and sacked the city before being either driven off or bought off.

The First Macedonian War saw the Romans involved directly in only limited land operations, but they ultimately achieved their objective of pre-occupying Philip and preventing him from aiding Hannibal.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kingdom sent an ambassador to Italy in an attempt to form an alliance against Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Macedonia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Philip V want to extend his control to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">westward</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What peninsula was the kingdom of Macedonia able to be found in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greek peninsula</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what point did Rome discover that an alliance between Philip V and Hannibal had been achieved?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Philip's emissaries were captured by a Roman fleet</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Philip V seek an alliance with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hannibal</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The past century had seen the Greek world dominated by the three primary successor kingdoms of Alexander the Great's empire: Ptolemaic Egypt, Macedonia and the Seleucid Empire. In 202 BC, internal problems led to a weakening of Egypt's position, thereby disrupting the power balance among the successor states. Macedonia and the Seleucid Empire agreed to an alliance to conquer and divide Egypt. Fearing this increasingly unstable situation, several small Greek kingdoms sent delegations to Rome to seek an alliance. The delegation succeeded, even though prior Greek attempts to involve Rome in Greek affairs had been met with Roman apathy. Our primary source about these events, the surviving works of Polybius, do not state Rome's reason for getting involved. Rome gave Philip an ultimatum to cease his campaigns against Rome's new Greek allies. Doubting Rome's strength (a reasonable doubt, given Rome's performance in the First Macedonian War) Philip ignored the request, and Rome sent an army of Romans and Greek allies, beginning the Second Macedonian War. Despite his recent successes against the Greeks and earlier successes against Rome, Philip's army buckled under the pressure from the Roman-Greek army. In 197 BC, the Romans decisively defeated Philip at the Battle of Cynoscephalae, and Philip was forced to give up his recent Greek conquests. The Romans declared the &quot;Peace of the Greeks&quot;, believing that Philip's defeat now meant that Greece would be stable. They pulled out of Greece entirely, maintaining minimal contacts with their Greek allies.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was declared by the Romans now that the Philip had been defeated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Peace of the Greeks&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Romans remove their troops from after Philip's loss?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greece</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What request of Rome was ignored by Philip V that quickly led to the start of the Second Macedonian War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an ultimatum to cease his campaigns against Rome's new Greek allies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Philip lose the Battle of Cynoscephalae?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">197 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Philip forced to return after his loss in the Battle of Cynoscephalae?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his recent Greek conquests</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With Egypt and Macedonia weakened, the Seleucid Empire made increasingly aggressive and successful attempts to conquer the entire Greek world.

They even established a major garrison in Sicily in case the Seleucids ever got to Italy. This fear was shared by Rome's Greek allies, who had largely ignored Rome in the years after the Second Macedonian War, but now followed Rome again for the first time since that war. A major Roman-Greek force was mobilized under the command of the great hero of the Second Punic War, Scipio Africanus, and set out for Greece, beginning the Roman-Syrian War. After initial fighting that revealed serious Seleucid weaknesses, the Seleucids tried to turn the Roman strength against them at the Battle of Thermopylae (as they believed the 300 Spartans had done centuries earlier). Like the Spartans, the Seleucids lost the battle, and were forced to evacuate Greece. The Romans pursued the Seleucids by crossing the Hellespont, which marked the first time a Roman army had ever entered Asia. The decisive engagement was fought at the Battle of Magnesia, resulting in a complete Roman victory. The Seleucids sued for peace, and Rome forced them to give up their recent Greek conquests. Although they still controlled a great deal of territory, this defeat marked the decline of their empire, as they were to begin facing increasingly aggressive subjects in the east (the Parthians) and the west (the Greeks). Their empire disintegrated into a rump over the course of the next century, when it was eclipsed by Pontus. Following Magnesia, Rome again withdrew from Greece, assuming (or hoping) that the lack of a major Greek power would ensure a stable peace. In fact, it did the opposite.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which town in Italy now housed a large Roman garrison?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sicily</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was a garrison implented in Italy by the Romans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in case the Seleucids ever got to Italy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who had been defeated in the Battle of Thermopylae?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Seleucids</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did the Romans decide to withdraw their forces from Greece?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">assuming (or hoping) that the lack of a major Greek power would ensure a stable peace</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What loss started a decline of the Seleucids Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Battle of Magnesia</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 179 BC Philip died.

The most important constitutional change during the transition from kingdom to republic concerned the chief magistrate. Before the revolution, a king would be elected by the senators for a life term. Now, two consuls were elected by the citizens for an annual term.

Further laws attempted to relieve the burden of debt from plebeians by banning interest on loans. In 337 BC, the first plebeian praetor was elected. During these years, the tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close. The senate realised the need to use plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals. To win over the tribunes, the senators gave the tribunes a great deal of power and the tribunes began to feel obligated to the senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators were often able to secure the tribunate for members of their own families.

Thus, the number of plebeian senators probably increased quickly. However, it remained difficult for a plebeian to enter the senate if he was not from a well-known political family, as a new patrician-like plebeian aristocracy emerged.

The dictator passed a law (the Lex Hortensia), which ended the requirement that the patrician senators must agree before any bill could be considered by the Plebeian Council. This was not the first law to require that an act of the Plebeian Council have the full force of law. The Plebeian Council acquired this power during a modification to the original Valerian law in 449 BC.

The army, however, was defeated. One of Marius' old quaestors, Lucius Cornelius Sulla, had been elected consul for the year, and was ordered by the senate to assume command of the war against Mithridates. Marius, a member of the &quot;populares&quot; party, had a tribune revoke Sulla's command of the war against Mithridates. Sulla, a member of the aristocratic (&quot;optimates&quot;) party, brought his army back to Italy and marched on Rome. Sulla was so angry at Marius' tribune that he passed a law intended to permanently weaken the tribunate. He then returned to his war against Mithridates.

The movement was based in the town of Faesulae, which was a natural hotbed of agrarian agitation. The rural malcontents were to advance on Rome, and be aided by an uprising within the city. After assassinating the consuls and most of the senators, Catiline would be free to enact his reforms. The conspiracy was set in motion in 63 BC. The consul for the year, Marcus Tullius Cicero, intercepted messages that Catiline had sent in an attempt to recruit more members. As a result, the top conspirators in Rome (including at least one former consul) were executed by authorisation (of dubious constitutionality) of the senate, and the planned uprising was disrupted.

He facilitated the election of the former patrician Publius Clodius Pulcher to the tribunate for 58 BC. Clodius set about depriving Caesar's senatorial enemies of two of their more obstinate leaders in Cato and Cicero. Clodius was a bitter opponent of Cicero because Cicero had testified against him in a sacrilege case. Clodius attempted to try Cicero for executing citizens without a trial during the Catiline conspiracy, resulting in Cicero going into self-imposed exile and his house in Rome being burnt down. Clodius also passed a bill that forced Cato to lead the invasion of Cyprus which would keep him away from Rome for some years.

Meanwhile, the senators adopted Pompey as their new champion against Caesar. On 7 January of 49 BC, the senate passed a senatus consultum ultimum, which vested Pompey with dictatorial powers.

Their duties were often financial.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which official had supremacy in both civil and military matters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Consuls</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was responsible for the adminstration of civil laws?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Praetors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was responsible for the handling of the Roman census?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two censors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long could an elected censor remain in office for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">18-month term</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What officer primarily had duties over finance matters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">quaestors</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Since the tribunes were considered to be the embodiment of the plebeians, they were sacrosanct.

Each household had an altar (lararium), at which the family members would offer prayers, perform rites, and interact with the household gods. Many of the gods that Romans worshiped came from the Proto-Indo-European pantheon, others were based on Greek gods. The two most famous deities were Jupiter (the king God) and Mars (the god of war).
