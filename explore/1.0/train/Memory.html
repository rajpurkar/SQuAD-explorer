Encoding allows information from the outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and physical stimuli. In the first stage the information must be changed so that it may be put into the encoding process. Storage is the second memory stage or process. This entails that information is maintained over short periods of time. Finally the third process is the retrieval of information that has been stored. Such information must be located and returned to the consciousness. Some retrieval attempts may be effortless due to the type of information, and other attempts to remember stored information may be more demanding for various reasons.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which three processes does phychology recognize as memory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> process in which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why may some memory retrieval processes fail?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the type of information, and other attempts to remember stored information may be more demanding for various reasons.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happens to information during the encoding process?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">g allows information from the outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and physical stimuli. </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the second memory stage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Storage </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the third process that happens during the memory process?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">retrieval of information that has been stored</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Short-term memory is believed to rely mostly on an acoustic code for storing information, and to a lesser extent a visual code.

Confusion with recalling acoustically similar letters rather than visually similar letters implies that the letters were encoded acoustically.

Short-term memory allows recall for a period of several seconds to a minute without rehearsal. Its capacity is also very limited: George A. Miller (1956), when working at Bell Laboratories, conducted experiments showing that the store of short-term memory was 7±2 items (the title of his famous paper, &quot;The magical number 7±2&quot;). Modern estimates of the capacity of short-term memory are lower, typically of the order of 4–5 items; however, memory capacity can be increased through a process called chunking. For example, in recalling a ten-digit telephone number, a person could chunk the digits into three groups: first, the area code (such as 123), then a three-digit chunk (456) and lastly a four-digit chunk (7890). This method of remembering telephone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits; this is because we are able to chunk the information into meaningful groups of numbers. This may be reflected in some countries in the tendency to display telephone numbers as several chunks of two to four numbers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for short-term memory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> working memory. </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What exactly does short-term memory allow a person to do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">recall for a period of several seconds to a minute without rehearsal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much information can one store and recall in short-term memory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">capacity is also very limited</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How can one higher their memory capacity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">chunking.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why do some countries display numbers in chunks of two to four numbers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">because we are able to chunk the information into meaningful groups of numbers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The storage in sensory memory and short-term memory generally has a strictly limited capacity and duration, which means that information is not retained indefinitely. By contrast, long-term memory can store much larger quantities of information for potentially unlimited duration (sometimes a whole life span). Its capacity is immeasurable. For example, given a random seven-digit number we may remember it for only a few seconds before forgetting, suggesting it was stored in our short-term memory. On the other hand, we can remember telephone numbers for many years through repetition; this information is said to be stored in long-term memory.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why can't some memories be held onto forever?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The storage in sensory memory and short-term memory generally has a strictly limited capacity and duration</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If a memory that is stored in with long term-memories, how long can you possibly rememeber it?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sometimes a whole life span)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the capacity of long term memory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> capacity is immeasurable</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If you knew a telephone number one week ago, but have forgotten it now, where was this memory stored?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in our short-term memory</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The model also shows all the memory stores as being a single unit whereas research into this shows differently.

Patient KF was brain damaged, displaying difficulties regarding short-term memory.

Long-term memory, on the other hand, is maintained by more stable and permanent changes in neural connections widely spread throughout the brain. The hippocampus is essential (for learning new information) to the consolidation of information from short-term to long-term memory, although it does not seem to store information itself. Without the hippocampus, new memories are unable to be stored into long-term memory, as learned from patient Henry Molaison after removal of both his hippocampi, and there will be a very short attention span. Furthermore, it may be involved in changing neural connections for a period of three months or more after the initial learning.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which part of the brain does short-term memory seem to rely on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">frontal lobe (especially dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and the parietal lobe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which part of the brain does long-term memory rely on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hippocampus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much information can the hippocampus store?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">does not </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If the hippocampus doesn't store information what does it do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">may be involved in changing neural connections for a period of three months or more after the initial learning.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Sensory memory holds sensory information less than one second after an item is perceived. The ability to look at an item and remember what it looked like with just a split second of observation, or memorization, is the example of sensory memory. It is out of cognitive control and is an automatic response. With very short presentations, participants often report that they seem to &quot;see&quot; more than they can actually report. The first experiments exploring this form of sensory memory were conducted by George Sperling (1963) using the &quot;partial report paradigm&quot;. Subjects were presented with a grid of 12 letters, arranged into three rows of four. After a brief presentation, subjects were then played either a high, medium or low tone, cuing them which of the rows to report. Based on these partial report experiments,Sperling was able to show that the capacity of sensory memory was approximately 12 items, but that it degraded very quickly (within a few hundred milliseconds). Because this form of memory degrades so quickly, participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items (12 in the &quot;whole report&quot; procedure) before they decayed. This type of memory cannot be prolonged via rehearsal.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long does sensory  memory to to store information?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> less than one second </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Can we control what is stored in our sensory memory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">It is out of cognitive control </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the first studies on exploring a new idea of sensory memory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> George Sperling</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Spellings' findings reveal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> this form of memory degrades so quickly, participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the item</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While short-term memory encodes information acoustically, long-term memory encodes it semantically: Baddeley (1966) discovered that, after 20 minutes, test subjects had the most difficulty recalling a collection of words that had similar meanings (e.g. big, large, great, huge) long-term.

Thus, retrospective memory as a category includes semantic, episodic and autobiographical memory. In contrast, prospective memory is memory for future intentions, or remembering to remember (Winograd, 1988). Prospective memory can be further broken down into event- and time-based prospective remembering. Time-based prospective memories are triggered by a time-cue, such as going to the doctor (action) at 4pm (cue). Event-based prospective memories are intentions triggered by cues, such as remembering to post a letter (action) after seeing a mailbox (cue). Cues do not need to be related to the action (as the mailbox/letter example), and lists, sticky-notes, knotted handkerchiefs, or string around the finger all exemplify cues that people use as strategies to enhance prospective memory.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some catgories of retrospective memory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">semantic, episodic and autobiographical memory</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If a memory is triggered by a time, which kind of memory is this?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Time-based prospective memories </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is something somebody can use to remember something?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cues</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If Bob realized he needed to mail his mother a letter after seeing the postal office, which kind of memory did he trigger?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Event-based prospective memories</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Hebb distinguished between short-term and long-term memory. He postulated that any memory that stayed in short-term storage for a long enough time would be consolidated into a long-term memory. Later research showed this to be false. Research has shown that direct injections of cortisol or epinephrine help the storage of recent experiences. This is also true for stimulation of the amygdala. This proves that excitement enhances memory by the stimulation of hormones that affect the amygdala. Excessive or prolonged stress (with prolonged cortisol) may hurt memory storage. Patients with amygdalar damage are no more likely to remember emotionally charged words than nonemotionally charged ones. The hippocampus is important for explicit memory. The hippocampus is also important for memory consolidation. The hippocampus receives input from different parts of the cortex and sends its output out to different parts of the brain also. The input comes from secondary and tertiary sensory areas that have processed the information a lot already. Hippocampal damage may also cause memory loss and problems with memory storage. This memory loss includes, retrograde amnesia which is the loss of memory for events that occurred shortly before the time of brain damage.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Was Hebb's thought of the relationship between short and long term memory true?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">esearch showed this to be false</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which drugs seemed to help someone remember earlier events?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> cortisol or epinephrine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What relationship does excitement and memory share?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">excitement enhances memory </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Bob was in a car accident and couldn't remember his wifes name, what part of his brain could have been damaged?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> hippocampus </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>One question that is crucial in cognitive neuroscience is how information and mental experiences are coded and represented in the brain.

Research has revealed that individuals’ performance on memory tasks that rely on frontal regions declines with age. Older adults tend to exhibit deficits on tasks that involve knowing the temporal order in which they learned information; source memory tasks that require them to remember the specific circumstances or context in which they learned information; and prospective memory tasks that involve remembering to perform an act at a future time.

In other words, when asked to imitate a two-step action sequence (such as putting a toy car in the base and pushing in the plunger to make the toy roll to the other end), 9-month-olds tend to imitate the actions of the sequence in the correct order (step 1 and then step 2). Younger infants (6-month-olds) can only recall one step of a two-step sequence.

Semantic memory allows the encoding of abstract knowledge about the world, such as &quot;Paris is the capital of France&quot;. Episodic memory, on the other hand, is used for more personal memories, such as the sensations, emotions, and personal associations of a particular place or time. Episodic memories often reflect the &quot;firsts&quot; in life such as a first kiss, first day of school or first time winning a championship. These are key events in one's life that can be remembered clearly. Autobiographical memory - memory for particular events within one's own life - is generally viewed as either equivalent to, or a subset of, episodic memory. Visual memory is part of memory preserving some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. One is able to place in memory information that resembles objects, places, animals or people in sort of a mental image. Visual memory can result in priming and it is assumed some kind of perceptual representational system underlies this phenomenon.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When remembering your first day of school or first dance, which memory are you using?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Episodic memories</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which type of memory enables us to remember knowledge of the world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Semantic memory</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When fondly remembering your memory, which type of memory are you using?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Autobiographical memory</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which type of memory is used when remembering something that we've seen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Visual memory</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Stress has a significant effect on memory formation and learning. In response to stressful situations, the brain releases hormones and neurotransmitters (ex. glucocorticoids and catecholamines) which affect memory encoding processes in the hippocampus. Behavioural research on animals shows that chronic stress produces adrenal hormones which impact the hippocampal structure in the brains of rats. An experimental study by German cognitive psychologists L. Schwabe and O. Wolf demonstrates how learning under stress also decreases memory recall in humans. In this study, 48 healthy female and male university students participated in either a stress test or a control group. Those randomly assigned to the stress test group had a hand immersed in ice cold water (the reputable SECPT or ‘Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor Test’) for up to three minutes, while being monitored and videotaped. Both the stress and control groups were then presented with 32 words to memorize. Twenty-four hours later, both groups were tested to see how many words they could remember (free recall) as well as how many they could recognize from a larger list of words (recognition performance). The results showed a clear impairment of memory performance in the stress test group, who recalled 30% fewer words than the control group. The researchers suggest that stress experienced during learning distracts people by diverting their attention during the memory encoding process.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can cause your memory to deterioriate or not work as well?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Stress</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which hormones are produces when a animal is stressed out?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> adrenal hormones</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who performed a study that involved having peoples hands in cold water while also memorizing words?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">L.

Glucocorticoids that are released during stress damage neurons that are located in the hippocampal region of the brain. Therefore, the more stressful situations that someone encounters, the more susceptible they are to memory loss later on. The CA1 neurons found in the hippocampus are destroyed due to glucocorticoids decreasing the release of glucose and the reuptake of glutamate. This high level of extracellular glutamate allow calcium to enter NMDA receptors which in return kills neurons. Stressful life experiences can also cause repression of memories where a person moves an unbearable memory to the unconscious mind.

Therefore, sleep has the greatest effect on memory consolidation. During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brain’s abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS). This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn’t enhance every memory. It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. When you are sleeping, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory. When you do not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong, resulting in a lower retention rate of memories. Sleep deprivation makes it harder to focus, resulting in inefficient learning. Furthermore, some studies have shown that sleep deprivation can lead to false memories as the memories are not properly transferred to long-term memory. Therefore, it is important to get the proper amount of sleep so that memory can function at the highest level. One of the primary functions of sleep is thought to be the improvement of the consolidation of information, as several studies have demonstrated that memory depends on getting sufficient sleep between training and test. Additionally, data obtained from neuroimaging studies have shown activation patterns in the sleeping brain that mirror those recorded during the learning of tasks from the previous day, suggesting that new memories may be solidified through such rehearsal.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Does sleep hurt a persons memory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does SWS stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">slow-wave sleep</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What take place during SWS?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">System consolidation </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the role of the neocortex whe it relates to memory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In studies what is a relationship between sleeping and learning?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">activation patterns in the sleeping brain that mirror those recorded during the learning of tasks from the previous day</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A UCLA research study published in the June 2006 issue of the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry found that people can improve cognitive function and brain efficiency through simple lifestyle changes such as incorporating memory exercises, healthy eating, physical fitness and stress reduction into their daily lives.

There are many sorts of amnesia, and by studying their different forms, it has become possible to observe apparent defects in individual sub-systems of the brain's memory systems, and thus hypothesize their function in the normally working brain. Other neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease can also affect memory and cognition.

A separate study by cognitive psychologists Schwabe and Wolf shows that when retention testing is done in a context similar to or congruent with the original learning task (i.e., in the same room), memory impairment and the detrimental effects of stress on learning can be attenuated. Seventy-two healthy female and male university students, randomly assigned to the SECPT stress test or to a control group, were asked to remember the locations of 15 pairs of picture cards – a computerized version of the card game &quot;Concentration&quot; or &quot;Memory&quot;. The room in which the experiment took place was infused with the scent of vanilla, as odour is a strong cue for memory. Retention testing took place the following day, either in the same room with the vanilla scent again present, or in a different room without the fragrance. The memory performance of subjects who experienced stress during the object-location task decreased significantly when they were tested in an unfamiliar room without the vanilla scent (an incongruent context); however, the memory performance of stressed subjects showed no impairment when they were tested in the original room with the vanilla scent (a congruent context). All participants in the experiment, both stressed and unstressed, performed faster when the learning and retrieval contexts were similar.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can impact memory performance in a positive way?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">when material is linked to the learning context, </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In their study what was the relationship that both groups shared?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">both stressed and unstressed, performed faster when the learning and retrieval contexts were similar.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can the scent of vanilla be used for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">strong cue for memory. </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did a study performed by Schwabe and wolf show?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">memory impairment and the detrimental effects of stress on learning can be attenuated.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In Schwabe and wolfs study what where particpants asked to memorize?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> were asked to remember the locations of 15 pairs of picture cards –</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Interestingly, research has revealed that asking individuals to repeatedly imagine actions that they have never performed or events that they have never experienced could result in false memories. For instance, Goff and Roediger (1998) asked participants to imagine that they performed an act (e.g., break a toothpick) and then later asked them whether they had done such a thing. Findings revealed that those participants who repeatedly imagined performing such an act were more likely to think that they had actually performed that act during the first session of the experiment. Similarly, Garry and her colleagues (1996) asked college students to report how certain they were that they experienced a number of events as children (e.g., broke a window with their hand) and then two weeks later asked them to imagine four of those events. The researchers found that one-fourth of the students asked to imagine the four events reported that they had actually experienced such events as children. That is, when asked to imagine the events they were more confident that they experienced the events.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can cause a person to have fake memories?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> repeatedly imagine actions that they have never performed or events that they have never experienced </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who performed a study that showed the similarirty of imaginging doing something and then later remembering actually doing that task?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Goff and Roediger</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did a similar study done by Garry find?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">esearchers found that one-fourth of the students asked to imagine the four events reported that they had actually experienced such events as children</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, it is not the case. The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime. In fact, research has revealed that our memories are constructed. People can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them. To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. The researchers found that the people who were asked, &quot;How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?&quot; gave higher estimates than those who were asked, &quot;How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?&quot; Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that they have seen broken glass than those who had been asked the question with hit. There was no broken glass depicted in the film. Thus, the wording of the questions distorted viewers’ memories of the event. Importantly, the wording of the question led people to construct different memories of the event – those who were asked the question with smashed recalled a more serious car accident than they had actually seen. The findings of this experiment were replicated around the world, and researchers consistently demonstrated that when people were provided with misleading information they tended to misremember, a phenomenon known as the misinformation effect.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has research shown about our memories?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">our memories are constructed</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does a person build their memories?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">when they encode them and/or when they recall them.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did a study done by Elizabeth Loftus and John palmer show?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> that when people were provided with misleading information they tended to misremember, a phenomenon known as the misinformation effect.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In their study what did people say they say when they really hadn't due to having the word &quot;smashed&quot; inserted into the question?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> broken glass </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Memorization is a method of learning that allows an individual to recall information verbatim. Rote learning is the method most often used. Methods of memorizing things have been the subject of much discussion over the years with some writers, such as Cosmos Rossellius using visual alphabets. The spacing effect shows that an individual is more likely to remember a list of items when rehearsal is spaced over an extended period of time. In contrast to this is cramming: an intensive memorization in a short period of time. Also relevant is the Zeigarnik effect which states that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed ones. The so-called Method of loci uses spatial memory to memorize non-spatial information.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most widely used way in learing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rote learning </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Zeigarnik effect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">states that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed ones. </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does memorization mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a method of learning that allows an individual to recall information verbatim</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What learning tool did Cosmos rosselliius write about?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> using visual alphabets.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the spacing effect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> shows that an individual is more likely to remember a list of items when rehearsal is spaced over an extended period of time</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
