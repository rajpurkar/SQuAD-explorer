There is evidence of human occupation from Paleolithic times, and of subsequent settlement in the Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. The county played a significant part in the consolidation of power and rise of King Alfred the Great, and later in the English Civil War and the Monmouth Rebellion.

Although &quot;Somersetshire&quot; was in common use as an alternative name for the county, it went out of fashion in the late 19th century, and is no longer used possibly due to the adoption of &quot;Somerset&quot; as the county's official name after the establishment of the county council in 1889.

By AD 600 they had established control over much of what is now England, but Somerset was still in native British hands. The British held back Saxon advance into the south-west for some time longer, but by the early eighth century King Ine of Wessex had pushed the boundaries of the West Saxon kingdom far enough west to include Somerset. The Saxon royal palace in Cheddar was used several times in the 10th century to host the Witenagemot. After the Norman Conquest, the county was divided into 700 fiefs, and large areas were owned by the crown, with fortifications such as Dunster Castle used for control and defence. Somerset contains HM Prison Shepton Mallet, which was England's oldest prison still in use prior to its closure in 2013, having opened in 1610. In the English Civil War Somerset was largely Parliamentarian, with key engagements being the Sieges of Taunton and the Battle of Langport. In 1685 the Monmouth Rebellion was played out in Somerset and neighbouring Dorset. The rebels landed at Lyme Regis and travelled north, hoping to capture Bristol and Bath, but they were defeated in the Battle of Sedgemoor at Westonzoyland, the last pitched battle fought in England. Arthur Wellesley took his title, Duke of Wellington from the town of Wellington; he is commemorated on a nearby hill by a large, spotlit obelisk, known as the Wellington Monument.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who invaded Britain when the Romans Left </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Britain was invaded by Anglo-Saxon peoples</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">It took how long for the Anglo Saxons to control  the Somerset area </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by the early eighth century King Ine of Wessex had pushed the boundaries of the West Saxon kingdom far enough west to include Somerset</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Saxon Royal Palace used for </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">was used several times in the 10th century to host the Witenagemot</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What prison does somerset county contain </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">HM Prison Shepton Mallet, which was England's oldest prison still in use prior to its closure in 2013, having opened in 1610</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What rebellion took place in Somerset in 1685 </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Monmouth Rebellion was played out in Somerset and neighbouring Dorset</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Industrial Revolution in the Midlands and Northern England spelled the end for most of Somerset's cottage industries. Farming continued to flourish, however, and the Bath and West of England Society for the Encouragement of Agriculture, Arts, Manufactures and Commerce was founded in 1777 to improve farming methods. Despite this, 20 years later John Billingsley conducted a survey of the county's agriculture in 1795 and found that agricultural methods could still be improved. Coal mining was an important industry in north Somerset during the 18th and 19th centuries, and by 1800 it was prominent in Radstock. The Somerset Coalfield reached its peak production by the 1920s, but all the pits have now been closed, the last in 1973. Most of the surface buildings have been removed, and apart from a winding wheel outside Radstock Museum, little evidence of their former existence remains. Further west, the Brendon Hills were mined for iron ore in the late 19th century; this was taken by the West Somerset Mineral Railway to Watchet Harbour for shipment to the furnaces at Ebbw Vale.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What ended Somersets cottage industry </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Industrial Revolution in the Midlands and Northern England spelled the end for most of Somerset's cottage industries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What flourished in Somerset after the Industrial revelotuion</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Farming continued to flourish</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Industry was important in the late 18th and 19th century of North Somerset</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Coal mining was an important industry in north Somerset</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the west somerset mineral way transport </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">iron ore in the late 19th century; this was taken by the West Somerset Mineral Railway to Watchet Harbour for shipment to the furnaces at Ebbw Vale</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Many Somerset soldiers died during the First World War, with the Somerset Light Infantry suffering nearly 5,000 casualties.

During the Second World War the county was a base for troops preparing for the D-Day landings. Some of the hospitals which were built for the casualties of the war remain in use. The Taunton Stop Line was set up to repel a potential German invasion.

They were designed to mimic the geometry of &quot;blacked out&quot; streets, railway lines, and Bristol Temple Meads railway station, to encourage bombers away from these targets. One, on the radio beam flight path to Bristol, was constructed on Beacon Batch. It was laid out by Shepperton Studios, based on aerial photographs of the city's railway marshalling yards. The decoys were fitted with dim red lights, simulating activities like the stoking of steam locomotives. Burning bales of straw soaked in creosote were used to simulate the effects of incendiary bombs dropped by the first wave of Pathfinder night bombers; meanwhile, incendiary bombs dropped on the correct location were quickly smothered, wherever possible. Drums of oil were also ignited to simulate the effect of a blazing city or town, with the aim of fooling subsequent waves of bombers into dropping their bombs on the wrong location. The Chew Magna decoy town was hit by half-a-dozen bombs on 2 December 1940, and over a thousand incendiaries on 3 January 1941. The following night the Uphill decoy town, protecting Weston-super-Mare's airfield, was bombed; a herd of dairy cows was hit, killing some and severely injuring others.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why were decoy towns used in WW2</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">decoy towns were constructed in Somerset in World War II to protect Bristol and other towns, at night</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the decoy towns mimic </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mimic the geometry of &quot;blacked out&quot; streets, railway lines, and Bristol Temple Meads railway station, to encourage bombers away from these targets</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who layed out  Beacon Batch </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Shepperton Studios, based on aerial photographs of the city's railway marshalling yards.

The county has two cities, Bath and Wells, and 30 towns (including the county town of Taunton, which has no town council but instead is the chief settlement of the county's only borough). The largest urban areas in terms of population are Bath, Weston-super-Mare, Taunton, Yeovil and Bridgwater. Many settlements developed because of their strategic importance in relation to geographical features, such as river crossings or valleys in ranges of hills. Examples include Axbridge on the River Axe, Castle Cary on the River Cary, North Petherton on the River Parrett, and Ilminster, where there was a crossing point on the River Isle. Midsomer Norton lies on the River Somer; while the Wellow Brook and the Fosse Way Roman road run through Radstock.

They consist of marine clay levels along the coast, and the inland (often peat based) moors. The Levels are divided into two by the Polden Hills; land to the south is drained by the River Parrett while land to the north is drained by the River Axe and the River Brue. The total area of the Levels amounts to about 647.5 square kilometres (160,000 acres) and broadly corresponds to the administrative district of Sedgemoor but also includes the south west of Mendip district. Approximately 70% of the area is grassland and 30% is arable. Stretching about 32 kilometres (20 mi) inland, this expanse of flat land barely rises above sea level. Before it was drained, much of the land was under a shallow brackish sea in winter and was marsh land in summer. Drainage began with the Romans, and was restarted at various times: by the Anglo-Saxons; in the Middle Ages by the Glastonbury Abbey, from 1400–1770; and during the Second World War, with the construction of the Huntspill River.

The annual mean temperature is approximately 10 °C (50.0 °F). Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately 21 °C (69.8 °F). In winter mean minimum temperatures of 1 °C (33.8 °F) or 2 °C (35.6 °F) are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, but convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around 700 mm (28 in). About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the somerset climate like </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The annual sunshine rate of somerset </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many days of snow on average </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The average rainfall level of somerset </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Average rainfall is around 700 mm (28 in)</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Bridgwater was developed during the Industrial Revolution as the area's leading port. The River Parrett was navigable by large ships as far as Bridgwater. Cargoes were then loaded onto smaller boats at Langport Quay, next to the Bridgwater Bridge, to be carried further up river to Langport; or they could turn off at Burrowbridge and then travel via the River Tone to Taunton. The Parrett is now only navigable as far as Dunball Wharf. Bridgwater, in the 19th and 20th centuries, was a centre for the manufacture of bricks and clay roof tiles, and later cellophane, but those industries have now stopped. With its good links to the motorway system, Bridgwater has developed as a distribution hub for companies such as Argos, Toolstation, Morrisons and Gerber Juice. AgustaWestland manufactures helicopters in Yeovil, and Normalair Garratt, builder of aircraft oxygen systems, is also based in the town. Many towns have encouraged small-scale light industries, such as Crewkerne's Ariel Motor Company, one of the UK's smallest car manufacturers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the leading port of somerset </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bridgwater was developed during the Industrial Revolution as the area's leading port</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what was manufacture in Bridgeport in the 19th and 20th century</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">was a centre for the manufacture of bricks and clay roof tiles, and later cellophane, but those industries have now stopped</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The good motor system presently allows for </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bridgwater has developed as a distribution hub for companies such as Argos, Toolstation, Morrisons and Gerber Juice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">where are aircraft manufactured </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">AgustaWestland manufactures helicopters in Yeovil, and Normalair Garratt, builder of aircraft oxygen systems</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do many towns encourage </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Many towns have encouraged small-scale light industries, such as Crewkerne's Ariel Motor Company, one of the UK's smallest car manufacturers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Somerset is an important supplier of defence equipment and technology.

Fragments of willow basket were found near the Glastonbury Lake Village, and it was also used in the construction of several Iron Age causeways. The willow was harvested using a traditional method of pollarding, where a tree would be cut back to the main stem. During the 1930s more than 3,600 hectares (8,900 acres) of willow were being grown commercially on the Levels. Largely due to the displacement of baskets with plastic bags and cardboard boxes, the industry has severely declined since the 1950s. By the end of the 20th century only about 140 hectares (350 acres) were grown commercially, near the villages of Burrowbridge, Westonzoyland and North Curry.

Instead, in 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village, the first purpose-built factory outlet in the UK. C&amp;J Clark also had shoe factories, at one time at Bridgwater, Minehead, Westfield and Weston super Mare to provide employment outside the main summer tourist season, but those satellite sites were closed in the late 1980s, before the main site at Street.

Quarries at Doulting supplied freestone used in the construction of Wells Cathedral. Bath stone is also widely used. Ralph Allen promoted its use in the early 18th century, as did Hans Price in the 19th century, but it was used long before then. It was mined underground at Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines, and as a result of cutting the Box Tunnel, at locations in Wiltshire such as Box. Bath stone is still used on a reduced scale today, but more often as a cladding rather than a structural material. Further south, Hamstone is the colloquial name given to stone from Ham Hill, which is also widely used in the construction industry. Blue Lias has been used locally as a building stone and as a raw material for lime mortar and Portland cement. Until the 1960s, Puriton had Blue Lias stone quarries, as did several other Polden villages. Its quarries also supplied a cement factory at Dunball, adjacent to the King's Sedgemoor Drain. Its derelict, early 20th century remains, was removed when the M5 motorway was constructed in the mid-1970s. Since the 1920s, the county has supplied aggregates. Foster Yeoman is Europe's large supplier of limestone aggregates, with quarries at Merehead Quarry. It has a dedicated railway operation, Mendip Rail, which is used to transport aggregates by rail from a group of Mendip quarries.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of stone was supplied in the county </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> supplying freestone and building stone</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who promoted the use of stone from the  Bath area</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ralph Allen promoted its use in the early 18th century, as did Hans Price in the 19th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some uses for Blue Lias</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Blue Lias has been used locally as a building stone and as a raw material for lime mortar and Portland cement</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has been supplied by the county since the 1920's </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the county has supplied aggregates.

The present Diocese of Bath and Wells covers Somerset – with the exception of the Parish of Abbots Leigh with Leigh Woods in North Somerset – and a small area of Dorset. The Episcopal seat of the Bishop of Bath and Wells is now in the Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew in the city of Wells, having previously been at Bath Abbey. Before the English Reformation, it was a Roman Catholic diocese; the county now falls within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Clifton. The Benedictine monastery Saint Gregory's Abbey, commonly known as Downside Abbey, is at Stratton-on-the-Fosse, and the ruins of the former Cistercian Cleeve Abbey are near the village of Washford.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Artharian legend claim about Glastonbury</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Avalon became associated with Glastonbury Tor when monks at Glastonbury Abbey claimed to have discovered the bones of King Arthur and his queen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is built in Avalon </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the oldest above-ground Christian church in the World&quot; situated &quot;in the mystical land of Avalon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Episcopal seat of the Bishop is now where </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Episcopal seat of the Bishop of Bath and Wells is now in the Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew in the city of Wells, having previously been at Bath Abbey</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is St Greggorys abbey</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">is at Stratton-on-the-Fosse, and the ruins of the former Cistercian Cleeve Abbey are near the village of Washford</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The county has several museums; those at Bath include the American Museum in Britain, the Museum of Bath Architecture, the Herschel Museum of Astronomy, the Jane Austen Centre, and the Roman Baths.

The 19th century also saw the construction of railways to and through Somerset. The county was served by five pre-1923 Grouping railway companies: the Great Western Railway (GWR); a branch of the Midland Railway (MR) to Bath Green Park (and another one to Bristol); the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, and the London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR). The former main lines of the GWR are still in use today, although many of its branch lines were scrapped under the notorious Beeching Axe. The former lines of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway closed completely, as has the branch of the Midland Railway to Bath Green Park (and to Bristol St Philips); however, the L&amp;SWR survived as a part of the present West of England Main Line. None of these lines, in Somerset, are electrified. Two branch lines, the West and East Somerset Railways, were rescued and transferred back to private ownership as &quot;heritage&quot; lines. The fifth railway was a short-lived light railway, the Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Light Railway.
