The university, established in 1890, consists of The College, various graduate programs, interdisciplinary committees organized into four academic research divisions and seven professional schools. Beyond the arts and sciences, Chicago is also well known for its professional schools, which include the Pritzker School of Medicine, the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, the Law School, the School of Social Service Administration, the Harris School of Public Policy Studies, the Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies and the Divinity School. The university currently enrolls approximately 5,000 students in the College and around 15,000 students overall.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57283c464b864d19001647c8"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of university is the University of Chicago?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">a private research university</span><span class="answer">private research</span><span class="answer">private research university</span><span class="answer">private research university</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57283c464b864d19001647c9"><p> <strong class="question">When was the University of Chicago established?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1890</span><span class="answer">1890</span><span class="answer">1890</span><span class="answer">1890</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57283c464b864d19001647ca"><p> <strong class="question">How many professional schools does the University of Chicago have?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">seven</span><span class="answer">seven</span><span class="answer">seven</span><span class="answer">seven</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57283c464b864d19001647cb"><p> <strong class="question">How many academic research divisions does the University of Chicago have?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">four</span><span class="answer">four</span><span class="answer">four</span><span class="answer">four</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57283c464b864d19001647cc"><p> <strong class="question">How many students does the University of Chicago have enlisted?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">5,000</span><span class="answer">around 15,000</span><span class="answer">15,000</span><span class="answer">15,000</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>University of Chicago scholars have played a major role in the development of various academic disciplines, including: the Chicago school of economics, the Chicago school of sociology, the law and economics movement in legal analysis, the Chicago school of literary criticism, the Chicago school of religion, and the behavioralism school of political science. Chicago's physics department helped develop the world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction beneath the university's Stagg Field. Chicago's research pursuits have been aided by unique affiliations with world-renowned institutions like the nearby Fermilab and Argonne National Laboratory, as well as the Marine Biological Laboratory. The university is also home to the University of Chicago Press, the largest university press in the United States. With an estimated completion date of 2020, the Barack Obama Presidential Center will be housed at the university and include both the Obama presidential library and offices of the Obama Foundation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57283db6ff5b5019007d9fbc"><p> <strong class="question">University of Chicago scholars played a major part in what development?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">various academic disciplines</span><span class="answer">various academic disciplines</span><span class="answer">the world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction</span><span class="answer">the world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57283db6ff5b5019007d9fbd"><p> <strong class="question">Who helped develop the first man-made self-sustaining nuclear reaction?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Chicago's physics department</span><span class="answer">Chicago's physics department</span><span class="answer">Chicago's physics department</span><span class="answer">Chicago's physics department</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57283db6ff5b5019007d9fbe"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the first man-made self-sustaining nuclear reaction located?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">beneath the university's Stagg Field</span><span class="answer">Stagg Field</span><span class="answer">beneath the university's Stagg Field</span><span class="answer">beneath the university's Stagg Field</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57283db6ff5b5019007d9fbf"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the largest university press in the U.S?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">University of Chicago Press</span><span class="answer">University of Chicago Press</span><span class="answer">University of Chicago Press</span><span class="answer">University of Chicago Press</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57283db6ff5b5019007d9fc0"><p> <strong class="question">In what year will the Barack Obama Presidential Center be finished?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">2020</span><span class="answer">2020</span><span class="answer">2020</span><span class="answer">2020</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Founded by the American Baptist Education Society with a donation from oil magnate and wealthiest man in history John D.

Both Harper and future president Robert Maynard Hutchins advocated for Chicago's curriculum to be based upon theoretical and perennial issues rather than on applied sciences and commercial utility. With Harper's vision in mind, the University of Chicago also became one of the 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities, an international organization of leading research universities, in 1900.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57283f014b864d19001647e8"><p> <strong class="question">What society founded the University of Chicago?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the American Baptist Education Society</span><span class="answer">American Baptist Education Society</span><span class="answer">American Baptist Education Society</span><span class="answer">American Baptist Education Society</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57283f014b864d19001647e9"><p> <strong class="question">What person helped establish the school with a donation?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">John D.

Rockefeller on land donated by Marshall Field. While the Rockefeller donation provided money for academic operations and long-term endowment, it was stipulated that such money could not be used for buildings. The original physical campus was financed by donations from wealthy Chicagoans like Silas B. Cobb who provided the funds for the campus' first building, Cobb Lecture Hall, and matched Marshall Field's pledge of $100,000. Other early benefactors included businessmen Charles L. Hutchinson (trustee, treasurer and donor of Hutchinson Commons), Martin A. Ryerson (president of the board of trustees and donor of the Ryerson Physical Laboratory) Adolphus Clay Bartlett and Leon Mandel, who funded the construction of the gymnasium and assembly hall, and George C.

In 1896, the university affiliated with Shimer College in Mount Carroll, Illinois. Under the terms of the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice. Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program, as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part, and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university. The program passed into history by 1910.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572843304b864d1900164848"><p> <strong class="question">In 1890, who did the university decide to team up with?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">several regional colleges and universities</span><span class="answer">Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler University, and Stetson University</span><span class="answer">Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler University, and Stetson University</span><span class="answer">Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler University, and Stetson University</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572843304b864d1900164849"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the university team up with Shimer College?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1896</span><span class="answer">1896</span><span class="answer">1896</span><span class="answer">1896</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572843304b864d190016484a"><p> <strong class="question">The university agreed to grant a degree to any graduate of affiliate schoos that did what?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">made a grade of A for all four years</span><span class="answer">made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago</span><span class="answer">made a grade of A for all four years</span><span class="answer">made a grade of A for all four years</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572843304b864d190016484b"><p> <strong class="question">Who disliked the affiliate program?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">passed</span><span class="answer">Several University of Chicago professors</span><span class="answer">Several University of Chicago professors</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572843304b864d190016484c"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the affiliate program end?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1910</span><span class="answer">1910</span><span class="answer">Several University of Chicago professors</span><span class="answer">1910</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1929, the university's fifth president, Robert Maynard Hutchins, took office; the university underwent many changes during his 24-year tenure.

The institute will cost around $200 million and occupy the buildings of the Chicago Theological Seminary. During the same year, investor David G. Booth donated $300 million to the university's Booth School of Business, which is the largest gift in the university's history and the largest gift ever to any business school. In 2009, planning or construction on several new buildings, half of which cost $100 million or more, was underway. Since 2011, major construction projects have included the Jules and Gwen Knapp Center for Biomedical Discovery, a ten-story medical research center, and further additions to the medical campus of the University of Chicago Medical Center. In 2014 the University launched the public phase of a $4.5 billion fundraising campaign.

The university has an artist-in-residence program and scholars in performance studies, contemporary art criticism, and film history. It has offered a doctorate in music composition since 1933 and in Cinema &amp; Media studies since 2000, a master of fine arts in visual arts (early 1970s), and a master of arts in the humanities with a creative writing track (2000). It has bachelor's degree programs in visual arts, music, and art history, and, more recently, Cinema &amp; Media studies (1996) and theater &amp; performance studies (2002). The College's general education core includes a “dramatic, music, and visual arts” requirement, requiring students to study the history of the arts, stage desire, or begin working with sculpture. Several thousand major and non-major undergraduates enroll annually in creative and performing arts classes. UChicago is often considered the birthplace of improvisational comedy as the Compass Players student comedy troupe evolved into The Second City improv theater troupe in 1959. The Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts opened in October 2012, five years after a $35 million gift from alumnus David Logan and his wife Reva. The center includes spaces for exhibitions, performances, classes, and media production. The Logan Center was designed by Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. This building is actually entirely glass. The brick is a facade designed to keep the glass safe from the wind. The architects later removed sections of the bricks when pressure arose in the form of complaints that the views of the city were blocked.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572861cc4b864d190016495e"><p> <strong class="question">Since what year did the university offer a doctorate in music composition?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1933</span><span class="answer">1933</span><span class="answer">1933</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572861cc4b864d190016495f"><p> <strong class="question">Since what year did the university offer a doctorate in Cinema &amp; Media studies?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">2000</span><span class="answer">2000</span><span class="answer">2000</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572861cc4b864d1900164960"><p> <strong class="question">When did the university start having a bachelor's degree program in Cinema &amp; Media studies?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1996</span><span class="answer">1996</span><span class="answer">1996</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572861cc4b864d1900164961"><p> <strong class="question">When did the university start having a bachelor's degree program in theater &amp; performance studies?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">2002</span><span class="answer">2002</span><span class="answer">2002</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572861cc4b864d1900164962"><p> <strong class="question">Around roughly how many students enroll yearly in creative and performing arts classes?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Several thousand</span><span class="answer">Several thousand</span><span class="answer">Several thousand</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the fall quarter of 2014, the University of Chicago enrolled 5,792 students in the College, 3,468 students in its four graduate divisions, 5,984 students in its professional schools, and 15,244 students overall.
