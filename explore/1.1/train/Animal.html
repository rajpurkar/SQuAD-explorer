It can at times be difficult to separate the two feeding behaviours, for example, where parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on its decaying corpse.

During the beginning of the Tonian period around 1 billion years ago, there was a decrease in Stromatolite diversity, which may indicate the appearance of grazing animals, since stromatolite diversity increased when grazing animals went extinct at the End Permian and End Ordovician extinction events, and decreased shortly after the grazer populations recovered.

Among these, the sponges (Porifera) were long thought to have diverged first, representing the oldest animal phylum. They lack the complex organization found in most other phyla. Their cells are differentiated, but in most cases not organized into distinct tissues. Sponges typically feed by drawing in water through pores. However, a series of phylogenomic studies from 2008-2015 have found support for Ctenophora, or comb jellies, as the basal lineage of animals. This result has been controversial, since it would imply that that sponges may not be so primitive, but may instead be secondarily simplified. Other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as the earliest-diverging animal phylum is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Animal phyla that are recognized for their lack of bilateral symmetry are thought to have come from where?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">other animals early in evolution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which animal represents the oldest animal phyla?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sponges</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do sponges typically feed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">drawing in water through pores</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what time were a series of phylogenomic studies conducted that found support for comb jellies as the basal lineage of animals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2008-2015</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Deuterostomes differ from protostomes in several ways. Animals from both groups possess a complete digestive tract. However, in protostomes, the first opening of the gut to appear in embryological development (the archenteron) develops into the mouth, with the anus forming secondarily. In deuterostomes the anus forms first, with the mouth developing secondarily. In most protostomes, cells simply fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the mesoderm, called schizocoelous development, but in deuterostomes, it forms through invagination of the endoderm, called enterocoelic pouching. Deuterostome embryos undergo radial cleavage during cell division, while protostomes undergo spiral cleavage.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do deuterostomes and protostomes have in common?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">both groups possess a complete digestive tract</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which group does the anus form first, with the mouth developing secondarily?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">deuterostomes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the process in which cells fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the mesoderm called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">schizocoelous development</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the process in which the mesoderm is formed through invagination of the endoderm called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">enterocoelic pouching</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do deuterostome embryos undergo during cell division?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">radial cleavage</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Platyzoa include the phylum Platyhelminthes, the flatworms. These were originally considered some of the most primitive Bilateria, but it now appears they developed from more complex ancestors. A number of parasites are included in this group, such as the flukes and tapeworms. Flatworms are acoelomates, lacking a body cavity, as are their closest relatives, the microscopic Gastrotricha. The other platyzoan phyla are mostly microscopic and pseudocoelomate. The most prominent are the Rotifera or rotifers, which are common in aqueous environments. They also include the Acanthocephala or spiny-headed worms, the Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, and possibly the Cycliophora. These groups share the presence of complex jaws, from which they are called the Gnathifera.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for flatworm?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Platyhelminthes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some parasites included in the Platyhelminthes group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">flukes and tapeworms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does acoelomates mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lacking a body cavity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the flatworms closest relative?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gastrotricha</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are the rotifera most prominent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in aqueous environments</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Most animals indirectly use the energy of sunlight by eating plants or plant-eating animals. Most plants use light to convert inorganic molecules in their environment into carbohydrates, fats, proteins and other biomolecules, characteristically containing reduced carbon in the form of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Starting with carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), photosynthesis converts the energy of sunlight into chemical energy in the form of simple sugars (e.g., glucose), with the release of molecular oxygen. These sugars are then used as the building blocks for plant growth, including the production of other biomolecules. When an animal eats plants (or eats other animals which have eaten plants), the reduced carbon compounds in the food become a source of energy and building materials for the animal. They are either used directly to help the animal grow, or broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the animal the energy required for motion.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do most animals use the energy of sunlight?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eating plants or plant-eating animals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do plants use to convert inorganic molecules into carbohydrates, fats, proteins and other biomolecules?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">light</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does photosynthesis convert the energy of sunlight into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">chemical energy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When an animal eats plants or another animal that has eaten plants, what happens to the reduced carbon compounds in the food?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">become a source of energy and building materials for the animal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happens with the reduced carbon compounds in the food are broken down releasing stored solar energy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">giving the animal the energy required for motion</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
