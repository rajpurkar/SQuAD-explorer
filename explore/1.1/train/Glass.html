Glass will transmit, reflect and refract light; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make optical lenses, prisms, fine glassware, and optical fibers for high speed data transmission by light. Glass can be colored by adding metallic salts, and can also be painted and printed with vitreous enamels. These qualities have led to the extensive use of glass in the manufacture of art objects and in particular, stained glass windows. Although brittle, silicate glass is extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures. Because glass can be formed or molded into any shape, and also because it is a sterile product, it has been traditionally used for vessels: bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses. In its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights, marbles, and beads. When extruded as glass fiber and matted as glass wool in a way to trap air, it becomes a thermal insulating material, and when these glass fibers are embedded into an organic polymer plastic, they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material fiberglass. Some objects historically were so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material, such as drinking glasses and reading glasses.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What ingredient makes glass colorful?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">metallic salts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What in combination with glass fibers is used to make fiberglass?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">organic polymer plastic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What quality of silicate glass allows it to be used for windows?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">transparency</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of glass products can be used for sending information?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">optical fibers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what product are glass fibers used to hold dead air?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">thermal insulating material</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Most common glass contains other ingredients to change its properties. Lead glass or flint glass is more 'brilliant' because the increased refractive index causes noticeably more specular reflection and increased optical dispersion. Adding barium also increases the refractive index. Thorium oxide gives glass a high refractive index and low dispersion and was formerly used in producing high-quality lenses, but due to its radioactivity has been replaced by lanthanum oxide in modern eyeglasses.[citation needed] Iron can be incorporated into glass to absorb infrared energy, for example in heat absorbing filters for movie projectors, while cerium(IV) oxide can be used for glass that absorbs UV wavelengths.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What element is used in glass to keep it from becoming too hot?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Iron</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does barium affect glass?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">increases the refractive index</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What property of thorium oxide has caused it to no longer be used in eyeglasses?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">radioactivity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for lead glass?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">flint glass</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the benefit of thorium oxide in addition to its refractive index?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">low dispersion</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Fused quartz is a glass made from chemically-pure SiO2 (silica). It has excellent thermal shock characteristics, being able to survive immersion in water while red hot. However, its high melting-temperature (1723 °C) and viscosity make it difficult to work with. Normally, other substances are added to simplify processing. One is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, &quot;soda&quot;), which lowers the glass transition temperature. The soda makes the glass water-soluble, which is usually undesirable, so lime (calcium oxide [CaO], generally obtained from limestone), some magnesium oxide (MgO) and aluminium oxide (Al2O3) are added to provide for a better chemical durability. The resulting glass contains about 70 to 74% silica by weight and is called a soda-lime glass. Soda-lime glasses account for about 90% of manufactured glass.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What causes glass to dissolve in water?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">soda</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is lime often added to glass?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">better chemical durability</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of soda-lime glass is silica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">70 to 74</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a benefit of fused quartz?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">excellent thermal shock characteristics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What besides viscosity is a drawback of fused quartz?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">high melting-temperature</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following the glass batch preparation and mixing, the raw materials are transported to the furnace. Soda-lime glass for mass production is melted in gas fired units. Smaller scale furnaces for specialty glasses include electric melters, pot furnaces, and day tanks. After melting, homogenization and refining (removal of bubbles), the glass is formed. Flat glass for windows and similar applications is formed by the float glass process, developed between 1953 and 1957 by Sir Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers, who created a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity. The top surface of the glass is subjected to nitrogen under pressure to obtain a polished finish. Container glass for common bottles and jars is formed by blowing and pressing methods. This glass is often slightly modified chemically (with more alumina and calcium oxide) for greater water resistance. Further glass forming techniques are summarized in the table Glass forming techniques.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happens during refining?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">removal of bubbles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What method is used for making windows?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">float glass process</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is used on the surface of window glass to make it smooth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nitrogen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is added to the glass of jars to improve water resistance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">alumina and calcium oxide</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the inventors of the float glass process?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Glass has the ability to refract, reflect, and transmit light following geometrical optics, without scattering it. It is used in the manufacture of lenses and windows. Common glass has a refraction index around 1.5. This may be modified by adding low-density materials such as boron, which lowers the index of refraction (see crown glass), or increased (to as much as 1.8) with high-density materials such as (classically) lead oxide (see flint glass and lead glass), or in modern uses, less toxic oxides of zirconium, titanium, or barium.

The term glass, in popular usage, is often used to refer only to this type of material, which is familiar from use as window glass and in glass bottles. Of the many silica-based glasses that exist, ordinary glazing and container glass is formed from a specific type called soda-lime glass, composed of approximately 75% silicon dioxide (SiO2), sodium oxide (Na2O) from sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), calcium oxide, also called lime (CaO), and several minor additives. A very clear and durable quartz glass can be made from pure silica, but the high melting point and very narrow glass transition of quartz make glassblowing and hot working difficult. In glasses like soda lime, the compounds added to quartz are used to lower the melting temperature and improve workability, at a cost in the toughness, thermal stability, and optical transmittance.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which kinds of glass existed the furthest in the past?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">silicate glasses</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of glass are containers made from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">soda-lime glass</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is sand mostly made of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">silica</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can a very strong and transparent glass be made from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pure silica</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What types of glass is the word commonly used to mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">silicate glasses</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Glass is in widespread use largely due to the production of glass compositions that are transparent to visible light. In contrast, polycrystalline materials do not generally transmit visible light. The individual crystallites may be transparent, but their facets (grain boundaries) reflect or scatter light resulting in diffuse reflection. Glass does not contain the internal subdivisions associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals and hence does not scatter light in the same manner as a polycrystalline material. The surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow surface tension, which imposes a microscopically smooth surface. These properties, which give glass its clearness, can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing—i.e., colored.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does glass lack, allowing it to be transparent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">internal subdivisions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What force gives glass its surface texture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">surface tension</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What, in contrast to glass, doesn't let light pass through?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">polycrystalline materials</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of glass absorbs some light?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">colored</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Naturally occurring glass, especially the volcanic glass obsidian, has been used by many Stone Age societies across the globe for the production of sharp cutting tools and, due to its limited source areas, was extensively traded.

Ordinary soda-lime glass appears colorless to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron(II) oxide (FeO) impurities of up to 0.1 wt% produce a green tint, which can be viewed in thick pieces or with the aid of scientific instruments. Further FeO and Cr2O3 additions may be used for the production of green bottles. Sulfur, together with carbon and iron salts, is used to form iron polysulfides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black. A glass melt can also acquire an amber color from a reducing combustion atmosphere. Manganese dioxide can be added in small amounts to remove the green tint given by iron(II) oxide. When used in art glass or studio glass is colored using closely guarded recipes that involve specific combinations of metal oxides, melting temperatures and 'cook' times. Most colored glass used in the art market is manufactured in volume by vendors who serve this market although there are some glassmakers with the ability to make their own color from raw materials.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can give glass a faint green tinge?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">iron(II) oxide</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can prevent a green color in glass?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Manganese dioxide</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other than additives can give glass a yellow color?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reducing combustion atmosphere</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What chemical compounds can make glass nearly black?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">iron polysulfides</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Charged ions can be used to produce what in glass?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Color</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Glass remained a luxury material, and the disasters that overtook Late Bronze Age civilizations seem to have brought glass-making to a halt.

Anglo-Saxon glass has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites. Glass in the Anglo-Saxon period was used in the manufacture of a range of objects including vessels, beads, windows and was also used in jewelry. From the 10th-century onwards, glass was employed in stained glass windows of churches and cathedrals, with famous examples at Chartres Cathedral and the Basilica of Saint Denis. By the 14th-century, architects were designing buildings with walls of stained glass such as Sainte-Chapelle, Paris, (1203–1248) and the East end of Gloucester Cathedral. Stained glass had a major revival with Gothic Revival architecture in the 19th-century. With the Renaissance, and a change in architectural style, the use of large stained glass windows became less prevalent. The use of domestic stained glass increased until most substantial houses had glass windows. These were initially small panes leaded together, but with the changes in technology, glass could be manufactured relatively cheaply in increasingly larger sheets. This led to larger window panes, and, in the 20th-century, to much larger windows in ordinary domestic and commercial buildings.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did stained glass make a big comeback?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">19th-century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did stained glass begin to be used for places of worship?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10th-century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did big windows of stained glass become less common?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Renaissance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What 13th-century building is an example of stained glass walls?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sainte-Chapelle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did technological changes allow regular homes to have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">larger windows</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the 20th century, new types of glass such as laminated glass, reinforced glass and glass bricks have increased the use of glass as a building material and resulted in new applications of glass.

The viscosity decrease of lead glass melt is very significant (roughly 100 times in comparison with soda glasses); this allows easier removal of bubbles and working at lower temperatures, hence its frequent use as an additive in vitreous enamels and glass solders. The high ionic radius of the Pb2+ ion renders it highly immobile in the matrix and hinders the movement of other ions; lead glasses therefore have high electrical resistance, about two orders of magnitude higher than soda-lime glass (108.5 vs 106.5 Ohm·cm, DC at 250 °C).

Their mobility decreases the chemical resistance of the glass, allowing leaching by water and facilitating corrosion. Alkaline earth ions, with their two positive charges and requirement for two non-bridging oxygen ions to compensate for their charge, are much less mobile themselves and also hinder diffusion of other ions, especially the alkalis. The most common commercial glasses contain both alkali and alkaline earth ions (usually sodium and calcium), for easier processing and satisfying corrosion resistance. Corrosion resistance of glass can be achieved by dealkalization, removal of the alkali ions from the glass surface by reaction with e.g. sulfur or fluorine compounds.

The raw materials for laboratory-scale glass melts are often different from those used in mass production because the cost factor has a low priority. In the laboratory mostly pure chemicals are used. Care must be taken that the raw materials have not reacted with moisture or other chemicals in the environment (such as alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides and hydroxides, or boron oxide), or that the impurities are quantified (loss on ignition). Evaporation losses during glass melting should be considered during the selection of the raw materials, e.g., sodium selenite may be preferred over easily evaporating SeO2. Also, more readily reacting raw materials may be preferred over relatively inert ones, such as Al(OH)3 over Al2O3. Usually, the melts are carried out in platinum crucibles to reduce contamination from the crucible material. Glass homogeneity is achieved by homogenizing the raw materials mixture (glass batch), by stirring the melt, and by crushing and re-melting the first melt. The obtained glass is usually annealed to prevent breakage during processing.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What material is useful in glassmaking because of its slow evaporation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sodium selenite</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What containers are used for melting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">platinum crucibles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why are different materials used in a lab than are used in factory production?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the cost factor has a low priority</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the reason for crushing the glass and melting it again?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">homogeneity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is glass annealed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to prevent breakage</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the past, small batches of amorphous metals with high surface area configurations (ribbons, wires, films, etc.) have been produced through the implementation of extremely rapid rates of cooling.
