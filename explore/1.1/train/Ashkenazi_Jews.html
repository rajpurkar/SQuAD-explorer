During the first decades of Israel as a state, strong cultural conflict occurred between Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews (mainly east European Ashkenazim). The roots of this conflict, which still exists to a much smaller extent in present-day Israeli society, are chiefly attributed to the concept of the &quot;melting pot&quot;.

Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by what concept?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yiddishkeit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is there a larger or smaller number of Jews that speak Yiddish today than in the past?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Yiddishkeit mean in the Yiddish language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Jewishness&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the past most Jews prayed in what language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the past, while most Jews prayed in one language, they used which other language in their secular lives?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yiddish</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In an ethnic sense, an Ashkenazi Jew is one whose ancestry can be traced to the Jews who settled in Central Europe. For roughly a thousand years, the Ashkenazim were a reproductively isolated population in Europe, despite living in many countries, with little inflow or outflow from migration, conversion, or intermarriage with other groups, including other Jews. Human geneticists have argued that genetic variations have been identified that show high frequencies among Ashkenazi Jews, but not in the general European population, be they for patrilineal markers (Y-chromosome haplotypes) and for matrilineal markers (mitotypes). However, a 2013 study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA, from the University of Huddersfield in England, suggests that at least 80 percent of the Ashkenazi maternal lineages derive from the assimilation of mtDNAs indigenous to Europe, probably as a consequence of conversion. Since the middle of the 20th century, many Ashkenazi Jews have intermarried, both with members of other Jewish communities and with people of other nations and faiths.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For what period of time were the Ashkenazim a reproductively isolated population in Europe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">For roughly a thousand years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A 2013 study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA was conducted by what university?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">University of Huddersfield in England</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In an ethnic sense, Ashkenazi Jews can trace their ancestry to Jews who settled where?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Central Europe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the last 50-60 years, have more or less Ashkenazi Jews intermarried with people outside of their community?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">many Ashkenazi Jews have intermarried, both with members of other Jewish communities and with people of other nations and faiths</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Human geneticists argue that genetic variations have been identified that show high or low frequencies among Ashkenazi Jews?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">high frequencies</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Relations between Ashkenazim and Sephardim have not always been warm.

Assuming this reference point the linkage disequilibrium in the Ashkenazi Jewish population was interpreted as &quot;matches signs of interbreeding or 'admixture' between Middle Eastern and European populations&quot;. On the Bray et al. tree, Ashkenazi Jews were found to be a genetically more divergent population than Russians, Orcadians, French, Basques, Italians, Sardinians and Tuscans. The study also observed that Ashkenazim are more diverse than their Middle Eastern relatives, which was counterintuitive because Ashkenazim are supposed to be a subset, not a superset, of their assumed geographical source population. Bray et al. therefore postulate that these results reflect not the population antiquity but a history of mixing between genetically distinct populations in Europe. However, it's possible that the relaxation of marriage prescription in the ancestors of Ashkenazim that drove their heterozygosity up, while the maintenance of the FBD rule in native Middle Easterners have been keeping their heterozygosity values in check. Ashkenazim distinctiveness as found in the Bray et al. study, therefore, may come from their ethnic endogamy (ethnic inbreeding), which allowed them to &quot;mine&quot; their ancestral gene pool in the context of relative reproductive isolation from European neighbors, and not from clan endogamy (clan inbreeding). Consequently, their higher diversity compared to Middle Easterners stems from the latter's marriage practices, not necessarily from the former's admixture with Europeans.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of the modern Ashkenazi genome could possibly be of European origin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">35 to 55 percent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is the percentage of admixture in the modern Ashkenazi genome higher or lower than previously thought?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">admixture is considerably higher</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Were Ashkenazi Jews found to be a more or less genetically divergent population than Russians, Orcadians, French, and Basques?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a genetically more divergent population</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In one study it was found that the Ashkenazim were more or less diverse than their Middle Eastern relatives?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more diverse</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Were the Ashkenazim thought to be a subset or superset of their assumed geographical source population?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ashkenazim are supposed to be a subset, not a superset</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Genetic studies on Ashkenazim have been conducted to determine how much of their ancestry comes from the Levant, and how much derives from European populations.

In addition, Jews from southern Italy, fleeing religious persecution, began to move into central Europe.[citation needed] Returning to Frankish lands, many Jewish merchants took up occupations in finance and commerce, including money lending, or usury. (Church legislation banned Christians from lending money in exchange for interest.) From Charlemagne's time to the present, Jewish life in northern Europe is well documented. By the 11th century, when Rashi of Troyes wrote his commentaries, Jews in what came to be known as &quot;Ashkenaz&quot; were known for their halakhic learning, and Talmudic studies. They were criticized by Sephardim and other Jewish scholars in Islamic lands for their lack of expertise in Jewish jurisprudence (dinim) and general ignorance of Hebrew linguistics and literature.

Sephardi communities suffered similar depletions in a few countries, including Greece, the Netherlands and the former Yugoslavia. As the large majority of the victims were Ashkenazi Jews, their percentage dropped from nearly 92% of world Jewry in 1931 to nearly 80% of world Jewry today. The Holocaust also effectively put an end to the dynamic development of the Yiddish language in the previous decades, as the vast majority of the Jewish victims of the Holocaust, around 5 million, were Yiddish speakers.

Different groups of religious Jews in different geographic areas historically adopted different customs and interpretations. On certain issues, Orthodox Jews are required to follow the customs of their ancestors, and do not believe they have the option of picking and choosing. For this reason, observant Jews at times find it important for religious reasons to ascertain who their household's religious ancestors are in order to know what customs their household should follow. These times include, for example, when two Jews of different ethnic background marry, when a non-Jew converts to Judaism and determines what customs to follow for the first time, or when a lapsed or less observant Jew returns to traditional Judaism and must determine what was done in his or her family's past. In this sense, &quot;Ashkenazic&quot; refers both to a family ancestry and to a body of customs binding on Jews of that ancestry.

Richards of the University of Huddersfield in England reached different conclusions, again corroborating the pre-2006 origin hypothesis. Testing was performed on the full 16,600 DNA units composing mitochondrial DNA (the 2006 Behar study had only tested 1,000 units) in all their subjects, and the study found that the four main female Ashkenazi founders had descent lines that were established in Europe 10,000 to 20,000 years in the past while most of the remaining minor founders also have a deep European ancestry. The study states that the great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Near East (i.e., they were non-Israelite), nor were they recruited in the Caucasus (i.e., they were non-Khazar), but instead they were assimilated within Europe, primarily of Italian and Old French origins. Richards summarized the findings on the female line as such: &quot;[N]one [of the mtDNA] came from the North Caucasus, located along the border between Europe and Asia between the Black and Caspian seas. All of our presently available studies including my own, should thoroughly debunk one of the most questionable, but still tenacious, hypotheses: that most Ashkenazi Jews can trace their roots to the mysterious Khazar Kingdom that flourished during the ninth century in the region between the Byzantine Empire and the Persian Empire.&quot; The 2013 study estimated that 80 percent of Ashkenazi maternal ancestry comes from women indigenous to Europe, and only 8 percent from the Near East, while the origin of the remainder is undetermined. According to the study these findings &quot;point to a significant role for the conversion of women in the formation of Ashkenazi communities.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A 2013 study estimates that what percentage of Ashkenazi maternal ancestry comes from women indigenous to Europe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">80 percent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A 2013 study estimates that what percentage of Ashkenazi maternal ancestry comes from women from the Near East?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">8 percent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A 2013 study estimates that what percentage of Ashkenazi maternal ancestry comes from women of undetermined origins?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">while the origin of the remainder is undetermined</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A 2010 study on Jewish ancestry by Atzmon-Ostrer et al. stated &quot;Two major groups were identified by principal component, phylogenetic, and identity by descent (IBD) analysis: Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews. The IBD segment sharing and the proximity of European Jews to each other and to southern European populations suggested similar origins for European Jewry and refuted large-scale genetic contributions of Central and Eastern European and Slavic populations to the formation of Ashkenazi Jewry&quot;, as both groups – the Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews – shared common ancestors in the Middle East about 2500 years ago. The study examines genetic markers spread across the entire genome and shows that the Jewish groups (Ashkenazi and non Ashkenazi) share large swaths of DNA, indicating close relationships and that each of the Jewish groups in the study (Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, Italian, Turkish, Greek and Ashkenazi) has its own genetic signature but is more closely related to the other Jewish groups than to their fellow non-Jewish countrymen. Atzmon's team found that the SNP markers in genetic segments of 3 million DNA letters or longer were 10 times more likely to be identical among Jews than non-Jews. Results of the analysis also tally with biblical accounts of the fate of the Jews. The study also found that with respect to non-Jewish European groups, the population most closely related to Ashkenazi Jews are modern-day Italians. The study speculated that the genetic-similarity between Ashkenazi Jews and Italians may be due to inter-marriage and conversions in the time of the Roman Empire. It was also found that any two Ashkenazi Jewish participants in the study shared about as much DNA as fourth or fifth cousins.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In a 2010 study, which two groups were identified by principal component, phylogenetic, and identity by descent analysis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The 2010 study found that what modern population is most closely related to Ashkenazi Jews?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">modern-day Italians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Ashkenazi Jews and Italians may be genetically similar due to what two factors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">inter-marriage and conversions in the time of the Roman Empire</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A 2013 trans-genome study carried out by 30 geneticists, from 13 universities and academies, from 9 countries, assembling the largest data set available to date, for assessment of Ashkenazi Jewish genetic origins found no evidence of Khazar origin among Ashkenazi Jews. &quot;Thus, analysis of Ashkenazi Jews together with a large sample from the region of the Khazar Khaganate corroborates the earlier results that Ashkenazi Jews derive their ancestry primarily from populations of the Middle East and Europe, that they possess considerable shared ancestry with other Jewish populations, and that there is no indication of a significant genetic contribution either from within or from north of the Caucasus region&quot;, the authors concluded.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many geneticists carried out the 2013 trans-genome study?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">30 geneticists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the 2013 trans-genome study find in regards to Ashkenazi Jews and Khazar origins?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">found no evidence of Khazar origin among Ashkenazi Jews</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many universities and academies participated in the 2013 trans-genome study?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">13 universities and academies</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The origins of the Ashkenazim are obscure, and many theories have arisen speculating about their ultimate provenance. The most well supported theory is the one that details a Jewish migration through what is now Italy and other parts of southern Europe. The historical record attests to Jewish communities in southern Europe since pre-Christian times. Many Jews were denied full Roman citizenship until 212 CE, when Emperor Caracalla granted all free peoples this privilege. Jews were required to pay a poll tax until the reign of Emperor Julian in 363. In the late Roman Empire, Jews were free to form networks of cultural and religious ties and enter into various local occupations. But, after Christianity became the official religion of Rome and Constantinople in 380, Jews were increasingly marginalized.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The most well supported theory on the origins of the Ashkenazim is one that details a Jewish migration through which modern day country?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">through what is now Italy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The historical record attests to Jewish communities in southern Europe since what time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pre-Christian times</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Many Jews were denied full Roman citizenship until what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">212 CE</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who gave Jews the right to full Roman citizenship?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Emperor Caracalla</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Historical records show evidence of Jewish communities north of the Alps and Pyrenees as early as the 8th and 9th century. By the 11th century Jewish settlers, moving from southern European and Middle Eastern centers, appear to have begun to settle in the north, especially along the Rhine, often in response to new economic opportunities and at the invitation of local Christian rulers. Thus Baldwin V, Count of Flanders, invited Jacob ben Yekutiel and his fellow Jews to settle in his lands; and soon after the Norman Conquest of England, William the Conqueror likewise extended a welcome to continental Jews to take up residence there. Bishop Rüdiger Huzmann called on the Jews of Mainz to relocate to Speyer. In all of these decisions, the idea that Jews had the know-how and capacity to jump-start the economy, improve revenues, and enlarge trade seems to have played a prominent role. Typically Jews relocated close to the markets and churches in town centres, where, though they came under the authority of both royal and ecclesiastical powers, they were accorded administrative autonomy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Jewish communities were seen north of the Alps and Pyrenees as early as which centuries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">8th and 9th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Jewish settlers appear along the Rhine by what century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">11th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two factors contributed the increase in Jewish settlers along the Rhine and other similar areas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">often in response to new economic opportunities and at the invitation of local Christian rulers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the first half of the 11th century, Hai Gaon refers to questions that had been addressed to him from Ashkenaz, by which he undoubtedly means Germany.
