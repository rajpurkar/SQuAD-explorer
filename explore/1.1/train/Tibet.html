It is the traditional homeland of the Tibetan people as well as some other ethnic groups such as Monpa, Qiang and Lhoba peoples and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of Han Chinese and Hui people. Tibet is the highest region on Earth, with an average elevation of 4,900 metres (16,000 ft).

The bulk of western and central Tibet (Ü-Tsang) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa, Shigatse, or nearby locations; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship. The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the Battle of Chamdo; most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai. The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were the current borders of Tibet established?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">18th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Tibetan empire emerge?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Chinese provinces used to be the eastern part of Tibet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sichuan and Qinghai</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which battle left parts of Tibet under Chinese rule?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Battle of Chamdo</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing dynasty in 1912, Qing soldiers were disarmed and escorted out of Tibet Area (Ü-Tsang). The region subsequently declared its independence in 1913 without recognition by the subsequent Chinese Republican government. Later, Lhasa took control of the western part of Xikang, China. The region maintained its autonomy until 1951 when, following the Battle of Chamdo, Tibet became incorporated into the People's Republic of China, and the previous Tibetan government was abolished in 1959 after a failed uprising. Today, China governs western and central Tibet as the Tibet Autonomous Region while the eastern areas are now mostly ethnic autonomous prefectures within Sichuan, Qinghai and other neighbouring provinces. There are tensions regarding Tibet's political status and dissident groups that are active in exile. It is also said that Tibetan activists in Tibet have been arrested or tortured.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Tibetan government abolished?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1959</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Xinhai revolt against the Qing dynasty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1912</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the Tibet Autonomous Region?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">western and central Tibet</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which battle led to Tibet's incorporation into the People's Republic of China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Battle of Chamdo</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The economy of Tibet is dominated by subsistence agriculture, though tourism has become a growing industry in recent decades.

In 1565 they were overthrown by the Tsangpa Dynasty of Shigatse which expanded its power in different directions of Tibet in the following decades and favoured the Karma Kagyu sect.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Phagmodrupa Dynasty founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Between 1346 and 1354</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded the Gelug school?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">disciples of Je Tsongkhapa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who dominated politics after 1435?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">minister family Rinpungpa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sect did the Tsangpa Dynasty of Shigatse favor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Karma Kagyu</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The 5th Dalai Lama is known for unifying the Tibetan heartland under the control of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, after defeating the rival Kagyu and Jonang sects and the secular ruler, the Tsangpa prince, in a prolonged civil war.

In 1750 the Ambans and the majority of the Han Chinese and Manchus living in Lhasa were killed in a riot, and Qing troops arrived quickly and suppressed the rebels in the next year. Like the preceding Yuan dynasty, the Manchus of the Qing dynasty exerted military and administrative control of the region, while granting it a degree of political autonomy. The Qing commander publicly executed a number of supporters of the rebels and, as in 1723 and 1728, made changes in the political structure and drew up a formal organization plan. The Qing now restored the Dalai Lama as ruler, leading the governing council called Kashag, but elevated the role of Ambans to include more direct involvement in Tibetan internal affairs. At the same time the Qing took steps to counterbalance the power of the aristocracy by adding officials recruited from the clergy to key posts.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Qing dynasty begin to rule in Tibet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1720</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Amdo come under Qing control?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1724</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Kham incorporated into neighboring Chinese provinces?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1728</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who restored the Dalai Lama as a ruler?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Qing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the governing councel called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kashag</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>For several decades, peace reigned in Tibet, but in 1792 the Qing Qianlong Emperor sent a large Chinese army into Tibet to push the invading Nepalese out.

There is also a well established Chinese Muslim community (gya kachee), which traces its ancestry back to the Hui ethnic group of China.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are Tibetan Muslims known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kachee</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Islamic influence in Tibet come from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Persia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year were all Tibetan Muslims declared Indiana citizens?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1959</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Chinese Muslim community called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gya kachee</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Roman Catholic Jesuits and Capuchins arrived from Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.

By 1627, there were about a hundred local converts in the Guge kingdom. Later on, Christianity was introduced to Rudok, Ladakh and Tsang and was welcomed by the ruler of the Tsang kingdom, where Andrade and his fellows established a Jesuit outpost at Shigatse in 1626.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Roman Catholic Jesuits and Capuchins arrive in Tibet from Europe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">17th and 18th centuries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Portuguese missionaries first arrive in western Tibet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1624</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Christianity introduced to Rudok, Ladakh, and Tsang?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1626</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1661 another Jesuit, Johann Grueber, crossed Tibet from Sining to Lhasa (where he spent a month), before heading on to Nepal.

Tibetans eat Guthuk (barley noodle soup with filling) on New Year's Eve with their families. The Monlam Prayer Festival follows it in the first month of the Tibetan calendar, falling between the fourth and the eleventh days of the first Tibetan month. It involves dancing and participating in sports events, as well as sharing picnics. The event was established in 1049 by Tsong Khapa, the founder of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama's order.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is worshipped during Tibet's various festibals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Buddha</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Tibetan New Year Festival called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Losar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do Tibetan's eat on New Year's Eve?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Guthuk</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When is the Monlam Prayer Festival?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">between the fourth and the eleventh days of the first Tibetan month</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who established the Monlam Prayer Festival in 1049?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tsong Khapa</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The most important crop in Tibet is barley, and dough made from barley flour—called tsampa—is the staple food of Tibet.
