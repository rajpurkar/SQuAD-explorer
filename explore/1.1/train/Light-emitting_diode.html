LEDs have many advantages over incandescent light sources including lower energy consumption, longer lifetime, improved physical robustness, smaller size, and faster switching. Light-emitting diodes are now used in applications as diverse as aviation lighting, automotive headlamps, advertising, general lighting, traffic signals, camera flashes and lighted wallpaper.

Biard and Gary Pittman discovered near-infrared (900 nm) light emission from a tunnel diode they had constructed on a GaAs substrate. By October 1961, they had demonstrated efficient light emission and signal coupling between a GaAs p-n junction light emitter and an electrically-isolated semiconductor photodetector. On August 8, 1962, Biard and Pittman filed a patent titled &quot;Semiconductor Radiant Diode&quot; based on their findings, which described a zinc diffused p–n junction LED with a spaced cathode contact to allow for efficient emission of infrared light under forward bias. After establishing the priority of their work based on engineering notebooks predating submissions from G.E. Labs, RCA Research Labs, IBM Research Labs, Bell Labs, and Lincoln Lab at MIT, the U.S. patent office issued the two inventors the patent for the GaAs infrared (IR) light-emitting diode (U.S. Patent US3293513), the first practical LED. Immediately after filing the patent, Texas Instruments (TI) began a project to manufacture infrared diodes. In October 1962, TI announced the first LED commercial product (the SNX-100), which employed a pure GaAs crystal to emit a 890 nm light output. In October 1963, TI announced the first commercial hemispherical LED, the SNX-110.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what state what near-infrared light emission discovered? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Texas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of diode was used to help discover near-infrared light emission?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tunnel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the patent filed for the Semiconductor Radiant Diode?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1962</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first practical LED?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">GaAs infrared (IR) light-emitting diode</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The two inventors of the first practical diode were employed by what famous company?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Texas Instruments (TI)</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first visible-spectrum (red) LED was developed in 1962 by Nick Holonyak, Jr., while working at General Electric Company.

Until 1968, visible and infrared LEDs were extremely costly, in the order of US$200 per unit, and so had little practical use. The Monsanto Company was the first organization to mass-produce visible LEDs, using gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) in 1968 to produce red LEDs suitable for indicators. Hewlett Packard (HP) introduced LEDs in 1968, initially using GaAsP supplied by Monsanto. These red LEDs were bright enough only for use as indicators, as the light output was not enough to illuminate an area. Readouts in calculators were so small that plastic lenses were built over each digit to make them legible. Later, other colors became widely available and appeared in appliances and equipment. In the 1970s commercially successful LED devices at less than five cents each were produced by Fairchild Optoelectronics. These devices employed compound semiconductor chips fabricated with the planar process invented by Dr. Jean Hoerni at Fairchild Semiconductor. The combination of planar processing for chip fabrication and innovative packaging methods enabled the team at Fairchild led by optoelectronics pioneer Thomas Brandt to achieve the needed cost reductions. These methods continue to be used by LED producers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first commercial uses of LEDs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">replacements for incandescent and neon indicator lamps</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did the early LEDs cost?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">US$200 per unit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was one use of early LED light in products?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">calculators</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What modern company introduced LEDs in 1968?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hewlett Packard (HP)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what decade were production costs greatly reduced for LEDs to enable successful commercial uses?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1970s</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first high-brightness blue LED was demonstrated by Shuji Nakamura of Nichia Corporation in 1994 and was based on InGaN.

This phenomenon is generally called electroluminescence, which can be defined as the emission of light from a semi-conductor under the influence of an electric field. The charge carriers recombine in a forward-biased P-N junction as the electrons cross from the N-region and recombine with the holes existing in the P-region. Free electrons are in the conduction band of energy levels, while holes are in the valence energy band. Thus the energy level of the holes will be lesser than the energy levels of the electrons. Some portion of the energy must be dissipated in order to recombine the electrons and the holes. This energy is emitted in the form of heat and light.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What converts absorbed light energy into an electric current?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">P-N junction</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the phenomenon where a P-N junction emits light when an electrical current is applied to it?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">electroluminescence</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are the free electrons located in the production of electroluminescence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the conduction band</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose energy levels are lower than the electrons in the electroluminescence process?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">holes existing in the P-region</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is some energy in the electroluminescence process emitted as heat and light?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to recombine the electrons and the holes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In September 2003, a new type of blue LED was demonstrated by Cree that consumes 24 mW at 20 milliamperes (mA).

In 1971, the year after Maruska left for Stanford, his RCA colleagues Pankove and Ed Miller demonstrated the first blue electroluminescence from zinc-doped gallium nitride, though the subsequent device Pankove and Miller built, the first actual gallium nitride light-emitting diode, emitted green light. In 1974 the U.S. Patent Office awarded Maruska, Rhines and Stanford professor David Stevenson a patent for their work in 1972 (U.S. Patent US3819974 A) and today magnesium-doping of gallium nitride continues to be the basis for all commercial blue LEDs and laser diodes. These devices built in the early 1970s had too little light output to be of practical use and research into gallium nitride devices slowed. In August 1989, Cree introduced the first commercially available blue LED based on the indirect bandgap semiconductor, silicon carbide (SiC).

Both Dr. Moustakas and Mr. Nakamura were issued separate patents, which confused the issue of who was the original inventor (partly because although Dr. Moustakas invented his first, Dr. Nakamura filed first).[citation needed] This new development revolutionized LED lighting, making high-power blue light sources practical, leading to the development of technologies like BlueRay, as well as allowing the bright high resolution screens of modern tablets and phones.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what decade were breakthroughs made that brought in the modern era of GaN-based optoelectronic devices?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1980s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who first patented a method to produce high-brightness blue LEDs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Shuji Nakamura</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who first invented a method to produce high-brightness blue LEDs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dr. Moustakas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What technology was made possible by high-power blue light sources?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">BlueRay</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one modern gadget that benefits from high-power blue LED lighting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tablets</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Nakamura was awarded the 2006 Millennium Technology Prize for his invention.

They have an active region consisting of one or more InGaN quantum wells sandwiched between thicker layers of GaN, called cladding layers. By varying the relative In/Ga fraction in the InGaN quantum wells, the light emission can in theory be varied from violet to amber. Aluminium gallium nitride (AlGaN) of varying Al/Ga fraction can be used to manufacture the cladding and quantum well layers for ultraviolet LEDs, but these devices have not yet reached the level of efficiency and technological maturity of InGaN/GaN blue/green devices. If un-alloyed GaN is used in this case to form the active quantum well layers, the device will emit near-ultraviolet light with a peak wavelength centred around 365 nm. Green LEDs manufactured from the InGaN/GaN system are far more efficient and brighter than green LEDs produced with non-nitride material systems, but practical devices still exhibit efficiency too low for high-brightness applications.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are cladding layers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">active region consisting of one or more InGaN quantum wells sandwiched between thicker layers of GaN</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How can light emission be varied from violet to amber?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">By varying the relative In/Ga fraction in the InGaN quantum wells</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does AlGaN stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Aluminium gallium nitride</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What LEDs are more efficient when produced from the InGaN/GaN systems than without?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Green</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With nitrides containing aluminium, most often AlGaN and AlGaInN, even shorter wavelengths are achievable.

In 2009, Seoul Semiconductor released a high DC voltage LED, named as 'Acrich MJT', capable of being driven from AC power with a simple controlling circuit. The low-power dissipation of these LEDs affords them more flexibility than the original AC LED design.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company has developed LEDs that can operate on AC power?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Seoul Semiconductor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the efficacy of an AC powered HP-LED?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">40 lm/W</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Seoul Semiconductor release the first high DC voltage LED?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2009</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is so good about ac powered HP-LEDs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more flexibility</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Seoul Semiconductor name their ac powered HP-LED?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Acrich MJT</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Alphanumeric LEDs are available in seven-segment, starburst and dot-matrix format.

Often a simple rectifier and capacitive current limiting are employed to create a low-cost replacement for a traditional light bulb without the complexity of creating a low voltage, high current converter which is required by single die LEDs.

If the applied voltage exceeds the LED's forward voltage drop by a small amount, the current rating may be exceeded by a large amount, potentially damaging or destroying the LED. The typical solution is to use constant-current power supplies to keep the current below the LED's maximum current rating. Since most common power sources (batteries, mains) are constant-voltage sources, most LED fixtures must include a power converter, at least a current-limiting resistor.

Having independent control of three illuminated colors allows the scanner to calibrate itself for more accurate color balance, and there is no need for warm-up. Further, its sensors only need be monochromatic, since at any one time the page being scanned is only lit by one color of light. Since LEDs can also be used as photodiodes, they can be used for both photo emission and detection. This could be used, for example, in a touchscreen that registers reflected light from a finger or stylus. Many materials and biological systems are sensitive to, or dependent on, light.

Although LED forward voltage is far more current-dependent than a Zener diode, Zener diodes with breakdown voltages below 3 V are not widely available.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What quality has LEDs been used as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">medium-quality</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What LED has the flattest I/V curve above the knee?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Red</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What LEDs have a very steep I/V curve?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nitride-based LEDs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">LED forward voltage is more current-dependent than what diode?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zener</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Zener diodes below what voltage are not widely available?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3 V</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
