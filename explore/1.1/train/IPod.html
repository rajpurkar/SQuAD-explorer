The iPod line came from Apple's &quot;digital hub&quot; category, when the company began creating software for the growing market of personal digital devices. Digital cameras, camcorders and organizers had well-established mainstream markets, but the company found existing digital music players &quot;big and clunky or small and useless&quot; with user interfaces that were &quot;unbelievably awful,&quot; so Apple decided to develop its own. As ordered by CEO Steve Jobs, Apple's hardware engineering chief Jon Rubinstein assembled a team of engineers to design the iPod line, including hardware engineers Tony Fadell and Michael Dhuey, and design engineer Sir Jonathan Ive. Rubinstein had already discovered the Toshiba disk drive when meeting with an Apple supplier in Japan, and purchased the rights to it for Apple, and had also already worked out how the screen, battery, and other key elements would work. The aesthetic was inspired by the 1958 Braun T3 transistor radio designed by Dieter Rams, while the wheel based user interface was prompted by Bang &amp; Olufsen's BeoCom 6000 telephone. The product (&quot;the Walkman of the twenty-first century&quot; ) was developed in less than one year and unveiled on October 23, 2001. Jobs announced it as a Mac-compatible product with a 5 GB hard drive that put &quot;1,000 songs in your pocket.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the iPod first introduced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2001</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did iPod sales show improvement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2004</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Apple engineer led original iPod design group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jon Rubinstein</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What radio was the primary inspiration for the look of the iPod?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Braun T3 transistor radio</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the storage capacity of the first iPod?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5 GB</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">in what year was the original iPod released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2001</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How large was the hard drive on the original iPod?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5 GB</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other popular music player did Apple compare their new product to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Walkman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of Apple's hardware engineering chief who helped design the iPod?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jon Rubinstein</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who manufactured the hard drives for the first iPods?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Toshiba</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Apple did not develop the iPod software entirely in-house, instead using PortalPlayer's reference platform based on two ARM cores. The platform had rudimentary software running on a commercial microkernel embedded operating system. PortalPlayer had previously been working on an IBM-branded MP3 player with Bluetooth headphones. Apple contracted another company, Pixo, to help design and implement the user interface under the direct supervision of Steve Jobs. As development progressed, Apple continued to refine the software's look and feel. Starting with the iPod Mini, the Chicago font was replaced with Espy Sans. Later iPods switched fonts again to Podium Sans—a font similar to Apple's corporate font, Myriad. iPods with color displays then adopted some Mac OS X themes like Aqua progress bars, and brushed metal meant to evoke a combination lock. In 2007, Apple modified the iPod interface again with the introduction of the sixth-generation iPod Classic and third-generation iPod Nano by changing the font to Helvetica and, in most cases, splitting the screen in half by displaying the menus on the left and album artwork, photos, or videos on the right (whichever was appropriate for the selected item).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which company worked with Apple in creating the user interface for the iPod?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pixo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the font used prior to the release of the iPod Mini?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chicago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the 6th gen iPod Classic released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2007</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The 6th gen iPod Classic and 3rd gen iPod nano featured which font?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Helvetica</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who supervised the design and implementation of the iPod user interface?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Steve Jobs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What software did Apple use as the basis for their iPod software?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">PortalPlayer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What typeface does the current iPod use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Helvetica</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 2006 Apple presented a special edition for iPod 5G of Irish rock band U2.

The problem is reduced when using high-impedance headphones and is completely masked when driving high-impedance (line level) loads, such as an external headphone amplifier. The first-generation iPod Shuffle uses a dual-transistor output stage, rather than a single capacitor-coupled output, and does not exhibit reduced bass response for any load.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What audio deficiency was found in the 3rd gen iPods?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">weak bass response</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of headphones could partially mitigate the bass response issues of the 3rd gen iPods?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">high-impedance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an example of a device that could entirely mitigate the bass response issues of the 3rd gen iPods?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">external headphone amplifier</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What part of audio output was substandard on 3rd generation iPods?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bass</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What component was to blame for the weak bass of the 3rd generation iPod?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">undersized DC-blocking capacitors</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>For all iPods released in 2006 and earlier, some equalizer (EQ) sound settings would distort the bass sound far too easily, even on undemanding songs.

The DRM could also be removed using third-party software. However, in a deal with Apple, EMI began selling DRM-free, higher-quality songs on the iTunes Stores, in a category called &quot;iTunes Plus.&quot; While individual songs were made available at a cost of US$1.29, 30¢ more than the cost of a regular DRM song, entire albums were available for the same price, US$9.99, as DRM encoded albums. On October 17, 2007, Apple lowered the cost of individual iTunes Plus songs to US$0.99 per song, the same as DRM encoded tracks. On January 6, 2009, Apple announced that DRM has been removed from 80% of the music catalog, and that it would be removed from all music by April 2009.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When the iTunes store was launched, what type of file format was used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">AAC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many computers were allowed to play files that used the FairPlay DRM system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what category could files without digital rights management be found on the iTunes store?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">iTunes Plus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Apple reveal that most of the iTunes selection was free from DRM?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">January 6, 2009</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By what time did Apple project its entire catalog would be free of DRM?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 2009</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the original format for purchased audio files on iTunes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">AAC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the DRM system originally used by Apple and iTunes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">FairPlay</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the premium service that offered higher quality and DRM-free songs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">iTunes Plus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was DRM completely eliminated from the iTunes offerings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2009</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>iPods cannot play music files from competing music stores that use rival-DRM technologies like Microsoft's protected WMA or RealNetworks' Helix DRM.

Apple initially considered the issue a minor defect, but later began shipping these iPods with protective sleeves.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are two subjects of criticism of iPods?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">short life-span and fragile hard drives</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What website ran a survey to learn how often iPods ceased working?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">MacInTouch</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How often did MacInTouch discover iPods stopped working, according to their survey?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">13.7%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did iPod owners take issue with the fragility of the iPod screen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">late 2005</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Apple include with the iPod to resolve the screen problem?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">protective sleeves</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which type of iPod storage proved more reliable than hard drive storage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">flash memory</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The first generation nano suffered from which component getting damaged easily?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">screen</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On June 11, 2006, the British tabloid The Mail on Sunday reported that iPods are mainly manufactured by workers who earn no more than US$50 per month and work 15-hour shifts.

If it is formatted on Windows, the FAT32 format is used. With the release of the Windows-compatible iPod, the default file system used on the iPod line switched from HFS+ to FAT32, although it can be reformatted to either file system (excluding the iPod Shuffle which is strictly FAT32). Generally, if a new iPod (excluding the iPod Shuffle) is initially plugged into a computer running Windows, it will be formatted with FAT32, and if initially plugged into a Mac running Mac OS it will be formatted with HFS+.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To work as a boot disk for a Mac, what file system must an iPod be formatted with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">HFS+</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If connected to a Windows PC when first set up, what file system will an iPod be formatted with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">FAT32</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
