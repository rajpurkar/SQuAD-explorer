During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a reputation as a center for left-wing politics.

The town became a regional transportation hub in 1839 with the arrival of the Michigan Central Railroad, and a north—south railway connecting Ann Arbor to Toledo and other markets to the south was established in 1878. Throughout the 1840s and the 1850s settlers continued to come to Ann Arbor. While the earlier settlers were primarily of British ancestry, the newer settlers also consisted of Germans, Irish, and African-Americans. In 1851, Ann Arbor was chartered as a city, though the city showed a drop in population during the Depression of 1873. It was not until the early 1880s that Ann Arbor again saw robust growth, with new immigrants coming from Greece, Italy, Russia, and Poland. Ann Arbor saw increased growth in manufacturing, particularly in milling. Ann Arbor's Jewish community also grew after the turn of the 20th century, and its first and oldest synagogue, Beth Israel Congregation, was established in 1916.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Ann Arbor has been linked with which university?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">University of Michigan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which town became the regional transport hub in 1878?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ann Arbor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the early settlers of Ann Arbor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which year was Ann Arbor chartered as a city?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1851</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1916, what was the name of the Synagogue that was establish?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Beth Israel Congregation</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a reputation as an important center for liberal politics. Ann Arbor also became a locus for left-wing activism and served as a hub for the civil-rights movement and anti-Vietnam War movement, as well as the student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group Students for a Democratic Society took place in Ann Arbor in 1960; in 1965, the city was home to the first U.S. teach-in against the Vietnam War. During the ensuing 15 years, many countercultural and New Left enterprises sprang up and developed large constituencies within the city. These influences washed into municipal politics during the early and mid-1970s when three members of the Human Rights Party (HRP) won city council seats on the strength of the student vote. During their time on the council, HRP representatives fought for measures including pioneering antidiscrimination ordinances, measures decriminalizing marijuana possession, and a rent-control ordinance; many of these remain in effect in modified form. Alongside these liberal and left-wing efforts, a small group of conservative institutions were born in Ann Arbor. These include Word of God (established in 1967), a charismatic inter-denominational movement; and the Thomas More Law Center (established in 1999), a religious-conservative advocacy group.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Thomas More Law center established?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1999</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Thomas More law group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a religious-conservative advocacy group</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the early &amp; mid 70's, which party won the city council seats?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Human Rights Party</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the past several decades, Ann Arbor has grappled with the effects of sharply rising land values, gentrification, and urban sprawl stretching into outlying countryside. On 4 November 2003, voters approved a greenbelt plan under which the city government bought development rights on agricultural parcels of land adjacent to Ann Arbor to preserve them from sprawling development. Since then, a vociferous local debate has hinged on how and whether to accommodate and guide development within city limits. Ann Arbor consistently ranks in the &quot;top places to live&quot; lists published by various mainstream media outlets every year. In 2008, it was ranked by CNNMoney.com 27th out of 100 &quot;America's best small cities&quot;.

Ann Arbor is about 35 miles (56 km) west of Detroit. Ann Arbor Charter Township adjoins the city's north and east sides. Ann Arbor is situated on the Huron River in a productive agricultural and fruit-growing region.

The elevation ranges from about 750 feet (230 m) along the Huron River to 1,015 feet (309 m) on the city's west side, near the intersection of Maple Road and Pauline Blvd. Generally, the west-central and northwestern parts of the city and U-M's North Campus are the highest parts of the city; the lowest parts are along the Huron River and in the southeast.

The city contains 157 municipal parks ranging from small neighborhood green spots to large recreation areas. Several large city parks and a university park border sections of the Huron River. Fuller Recreation Area, near the University Hospital complex, contains sports fields, pedestrian and bike paths, and swimming pools. The Nichols Arboretum, owned by the University of Michigan, is a 123-acre (50 ha) arboretum that contains hundreds of plant and tree species. It is on the city's east side, near the university's Central Campus.
