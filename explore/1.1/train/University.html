The University of Bologna adopted an academic charter, the Constitutio Habita, in 1158 or 1155, which guaranteed the right of a traveling scholar to unhindered passage in the interests of education. Today this is claimed as the origin of &quot;academic freedom&quot;. This is now widely recognised internationally - on 18 September 1988, 430 university rectors signed the Magna Charta Universitatum, marking the 900th anniversary of Bologna's foundation.

The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the Latin Church by papal bull as studia generalia and perhaps from cathedral schools. It is possible, however, that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception. Later they were also founded by Kings (University of Naples Federico II, Charles University in Prague, Jagiellonian University in Kraków) or municipal administrations (University of Cologne, University of Erfurt). In the early medieval period, most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who presided over classes at a scholae monasticae?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">monks and nuns</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a scholae monasticae?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">monastic schools</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What church is said to be responsible for the formation of universities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Latin Church</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the chronology of academic institutions, where are Christian cathedral schools compared to universities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">immediate forerunners</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During which era did universities grow out of already extant schools?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">early medieval period</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>All over Europe rulers and city governments began to create universities to satisfy a European thirst for knowledge, and the belief that society would benefit from the scholarly expertise generated from these institutions.

Some scholars believe that these works represented one of the most important document discoveries in Western intellectual history. Richard Dales, for instance, calls the discovery of Aristotle's works &quot;a turning point in the history of Western thought.&quot; After Aristotle re-emerged, a community of scholars, primarily communicating in Latin, accelerated the process and practice of attempting to reconcile the thoughts of Greek antiquity, and especially ideas related to understanding the natural world, with those of the church. The efforts of this &quot;scholasticism&quot; were focused on applying Aristotelian logic and thoughts about natural processes to biblical passages and attempting to prove the viability of those passages through reason. This became the primary mission of lecturers, and the expectation of students.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Roughly how many pages of the works of Aristotle were translated by the 12th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more than 3000 pages</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Richard Dales believes that the work of Aristotle represents the turning point of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Western thought</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What word described the early attempts to understand the work of Aristotle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">scholasticism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What faculty did scholars attempt to use to prove the thoughts of Aristotle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reason</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language did 12th century scholars studying Aristotle speak in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Latin</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The university culture developed differently in northern Europe than it did in the south, although the northern (primarily Germany, France and Great Britain) and southern universities (primarily Italy) did have many elements in common. Latin was the language of the university, used for all texts, lectures, disputations and examinations. Professors lectured on the books of Aristotle for logic, natural philosophy, and metaphysics; while Hippocrates, Galen, and Avicenna were used for medicine. Outside of these commonalities, great differences separated north and south, primarily in subject matter. Italian universities focused on law and medicine, while the northern universities focused on the arts and theology. There were distinct differences in the quality of instruction in these areas which were congruent with their focus, so scholars would travel north or south based on their interests and means. There was also a difference in the types of degrees awarded at these universities. English, French and German universities usually awarded bachelor's degrees, with the exception of degrees in theology, for which the doctorate was more common. Italian universities awarded primarily doctorates. The distinction can be attributed to the intent of the degree holder after graduation – in the north the focus tended to be on acquiring teaching positions, while in the south students often went on to professional positions. The structure of northern universities tended to be modeled after the system of faculty governance developed at the University of Paris. Southern universities tended to be patterned after the student-controlled model begun at the University of Bologna. Among the southern universities, a further distinction has been noted between those of northern Italy, which followed the pattern of Bologna as a &quot;self-regulating, independent corporation of scholars&quot; and those of southern Italy and Iberia, which were &quot;founded by royal and imperial charter to serve the needs of government.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which language was used in lectures in early European universities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Latin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For what subjects did professors use the work of Hippocrates?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">medicine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of subjects did the universities of northern Europe focus on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">arts and theology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of degree was given out at a English university?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bachelor's degrees</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Their endowment by a prince or monarch and their role in training government officials made these Mediterranean universities similar to Islamic madrasas, although madrasas were generally smaller and individual teachers, rather than the madrasa itself, granted the license or degree.

At the end of the Middle Ages, about 400 years after the first university was founded, there were twenty-nine universities spread throughout Europe. In the 15th century, twenty-eight new ones were created, with another eighteen added between 1500 and 1625. This pace continued until by the end of the 18th century there were approximately 143 universities in Europe and Eastern Europe, with the highest concentrations in the German Empire (34), Italian countries (26), France (25), and Spain (23) – this was close to a 500% increase over the number of universities toward the end of the Middle Ages. This number does not include the numerous universities that disappeared, or institutions that merged with other universities during this time. It should be noted that the identification of a university was not necessarily obvious during the Early Modern period, as the term is applied to a burgeoning number of institutions. In fact, the term &quot;university&quot; was not always used to designate a higher education institution. In Mediterranean countries, the term studium generale was still often used, while &quot;Academy&quot; was common in Northern European countries.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the time span of the Early Modern period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">late 15th century to 1800</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At the completion of the Middle Ages how long had universities existed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">about 400 years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many universities were within Europe at the closure of the middle ages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">twenty-nine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many universities were within Europe by the completion of the 18th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">143</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The German Empire had how many universities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">34</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression, as the 17th century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion. Many wars, and especially the Thirty Years' War, disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times. War, plague, famine, regicide, and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities. Internal strife within the universities themselves, such as student brawling and absentee professors, acted to destabilize these institutions as well. Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula, and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts. This era was also affected by the rise of the nation-state. As universities increasingly came under state control, or formed under the auspices of the state, the faculty governance model (begun by the University of Paris) became more and more prominent. Although the older student-controlled universities still existed, they slowly started to move toward this structural organization. Control of universities still tended to be independent, although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What war most curtailed the spread of universities in the 17th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Thirty Years' War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which university is said to have started faculty governance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">University of Paris</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which entity started to appoint the administration of universities in the 17th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the state</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The control of universities by the state can be attributed to the advancement in the development of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the nation-state.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How would one describe the control of universities before nation-states in the 17th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">student-controlled</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although the structural model provided by the University of Paris, where student members are controlled by faculty &quot;masters,&quot; provided a standard for universities, the application of this model took at least three different forms.

There was a collegiate or tutorial model based on the system at University of Oxford where teaching and organization was decentralized and knowledge was more of a generalist nature.

Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum, while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship. The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs cannot be underestimated. Once humanist professors joined the university faculty, they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis. Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction, to translate and interpret classical texts, and to live honorable lives. Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts, as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts. Professors of medicine such as Niccolò Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as well as translated important ancient medical texts. The critical mindset imparted by humanism was imperative for changes in universities and scholarship. For instance, Andreas Vesalius was educated in a humanist fashion before producing a translation of Galen, whose ideas he verified through his own dissections. In law, Andreas Alciatus infused the Corpus Juris with a humanist perspective, while Jacques Cujas humanist writings were paramount to his reputation as a jurist. Philipp Melanchthon cited the works of Erasmus as a highly influential guide for connecting theology back to original texts, which was important for the reform at Protestant universities. Galileo Galilei, who taught at the Universities of Pisa and Padua, and Martin Luther, who taught at the University of Wittenberg (as did Melanchthon), also had humanist training. The task of the humanists was to slowly permeate the university; to increase the humanist presence in professorships and chairs, syllabi and textbooks so that published works would demonstrate the humanistic ideal of science and scholarship.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the source of educational material in Early Modern age universities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sources did Early Modern age universities rely on for medical curricula?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Galen and Arabic scholarship</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The concentration on students to live honorable lives is an example of what form of thought?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Humanist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Niccolò Leoniceno was a professor of what subject?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">medicine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which individual added a humanist view into the Corpus Juris?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Andreas Alciatus</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although the initial focus of the humanist scholars in the university was the discovery, exposition and insertion of ancient texts and languages into the university, and the ideas of those texts into society generally, their influence was ultimately quite progressive. The emergence of classical texts brought new ideas and led to a more creative university climate (as the notable list of scholars above attests to). A focus on knowledge coming from self, from the human, has a direct implication for new forms of scholarship and instruction, and was the foundation for what is commonly known as the humanities. This disposition toward knowledge manifested in not simply the translation and propagation of ancient texts, but also their adaptation and expansion. For instance, Vesalius was imperative for advocating the use of Galen, but he also invigorated this text with experimentation, disagreements and further research. The propagation of these texts, especially within the universities, was greatly aided by the emergence of the printing press and the beginning of the use of the vernacular, which allowed for the printing of relatively large texts at reasonable prices.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Discovery and exposition were examples of the focus of what type of university scholar?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">humanist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A concentration on the study of the self resulted in what field of study?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the humanities</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What work did Vesalius push the study of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Galen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What spread the use of texts by Galen within universities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the printing press</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There are several major exceptions on tuition fees.

In fact, more than 80% of the European scientists between 1450–1650 included in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography were university trained, of which approximately 45% held university posts. It was the case that the academic foundations remaining from the Middle Ages were stable, and they did provide for an environment that fostered considerable growth and development. There was considerable reluctance on the part of universities to relinquish the symmetry and comprehensiveness provided by the Aristotelian system, which was effective as a coherent system for understanding and interpreting the world. However, university professors still utilized some autonomy, at least in the sciences, to choose epistemological foundations and methods. For instance, Melanchthon and his disciples at University of Wittenberg were instrumental for integrating Copernican mathematical constructs into astronomical debate and instruction. Another example was the short-lived but fairly rapid adoption of Cartesian epistemology and methodology in European universities, and the debates surrounding that adoption, which led to more mechanistic approaches to scientific problems as well as demonstrated an openness to change. There are many examples which belie the commonly perceived intransigence of universities. Although universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and methodologies as they emerged, when they did accept new ideas it helped to convey legitimacy and respectability, and supported the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of scientists from 1450–1650 in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography were taught in a university?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more than 80%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On the part of universities what was their reaction to giving up the Aristotelian system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">considerable reluctance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What university was Melancthon from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">University of Wittenberg</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The acceptance of new concepts and sciences by universities brought these ideas what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">legitimacy and respectability</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of epistemology was adopted for a short period of time in European universities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cartesian</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Regardless of the way the tension between universities, individual scientists, and the scientific revolution itself is perceived, there was a discernible impact on the way that university education was constructed.

The creation of new scientific constructs during the scientific revolution, and the epistemological challenges that were inherent within this creation, initiated the idea of both the autonomy of science and the hierarchy of the disciplines. Instead of entering higher education to become a &quot;general scholar&quot; immersed in becoming proficient in the entire curriculum, there emerged a type of scholar that put science first and viewed it as a vocation in itself.
