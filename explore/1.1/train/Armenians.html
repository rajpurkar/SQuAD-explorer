In the late Parthian period, Armenia was a predominantly Zoroastrian-adhering land, but by the Christianisation, previously predominant Zoroastrianism and paganism in Armenia gradually declined. Later on, in order to further strengthen Armenian national identity, Mesrop Mashtots invented the Armenian alphabet, in 405 AD. This event ushered the Golden Age of Armenia, during which many foreign books and manuscripts were translated to Armenian by Mesrop's pupils. Armenia lost its sovereignty again in 428 AD to the rivalling Byzantine and Sassanid Persian empires, until the Muslim conquest of Persia overran also the regions in which Armenians lived.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first country to make Christianity its official religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Arsacid Kingdom of Armenia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religion was Armenian paganism influenced by?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zoroastrianism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Armenia make Christianity its official religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">AD 301</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Armenia make Christianity its official religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in defiance of the Sassanids</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who invented the Armenian alphabet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mesrop Mashtots</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 885 AD the Armenians reestablished themselves as a sovereign kingdom under the leadership of Ashot I of the Bagratid Dynasty.

They settled in large numbers in Cilicia, an Anatolian region where Armenians were already established as a minority since Roman times. In 1080, they founded an independent Armenian Principality then Kingdom of Cilicia, which became the focus of Armenian nationalism. The Armenians developed close social, cultural, military, and religious ties with nearby Crusader States, but eventually succumbed to Mamluk invasions.

In 1441, a new Catholicos was elected in Etchmiadzin in the person of Kirakos Virapetsi, while Krikor Moussapegiants preserved his title as Catholicos of Cilicia. Therefore, since 1441, there have been two Catholicosates in the Armenian Church with equal rights and privileges, and with their respective jurisdictions. The primacy of honor of the Catholicosate of Etchmiadzin has always been recognized by the Catholicosate of Cilicia.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religion is dominant in the countries surrounding Armenia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Muslim</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are Hamshenis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ethnic Armenian Muslims</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who became Catholicos in Etchmiadzin in 1441?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kirakos Virapetsi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who remained Catholicos of Cilicia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Krikor Moussapegiants</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do the two Catholicosates compare?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">equal rights and privileges</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While the Armenian Apostolic Church remains the most prominent church in the Armenian community throughout the world, Armenians (especially in the diaspora) subscribe to any number of other Christian denominations.

This period of time is often viewed as the Golden Age of Armenian literature. Early Armenian literature was written by the &quot;father of Armenian history&quot;, Moses of Chorene, who authored The History of Armenia. The book covers the time-frame from the formation of the Armenian people to the fifth century AD. The nineteenth century beheld a great literary movement that was to give rise to modern Armenian literature. This period of time, during which Armenian culture flourished, is known as the Revival period (Zartonki sherchan). The Revivalist authors of Constantinople and Tiflis, almost identical to the Romanticists of Europe, were interested in encouraging Armenian nationalism. Most of them adopted the newly created Eastern or Western variants of the Armenian language depending on the targeted audience, and preferred them over classical Armenian (grabar). This period ended after the Hamidian massacres, when Armenians experienced turbulent times. As Armenian history of the 1920s and of the Genocide came to be more openly discussed, writers like Paruyr Sevak, Gevork Emin, Silva Kaputikyan and Hovhannes Shiraz began a new era of literature.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who came up with the Armenian alphabet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mesrop Mashtots</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Armenian writing begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">400 AD</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the 'father of Armenian history'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Moses of Chorene</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote 'The History of Armenia'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Moses of Chorene</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which European movement were the Revivalist authors similar to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Romanticists</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first Armenian churches were built between the 4th and 7th century, beginning when Armenia converted to Christianity, and ending with the Arab invasion of Armenia.

Armenians kept to their traditions and certain diasporans rose to fame with their music. In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States, the so-called &quot;kef&quot; style Armenian dance music, using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments (often electrified/amplified) and some western instruments, was popular. This style preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia, and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated. Richard Hagopian is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional &quot;kef&quot; style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 40s and 50s for developing their own style of &quot;kef music&quot; heavily influenced by the popular American Big Band Jazz of the time. Later, stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European (especially French) pop music, the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 60s and 70s with artists such as Adiss Harmandian and Harout Pamboukjian performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia. Also with artists such as Sirusho, performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today's entertainment industry. Other Armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned French-Armenian singer and composer Charles Aznavour, pianist Sahan Arzruni, prominent opera sopranos such as Hasmik Papian and more recently Isabel Bayrakdarian and Anna Kasyan. Certain Armenians settled to sing non-Armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band System of a Down (which nonetheless often incorporates traditional Armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs) or pop star Cher. Ruben Hakobyan (Ruben Sasuntsi) is a well recognized Armenian ethnographic and patriotic folk singer who has achieved widespread national recognition due to his devotion to Armenian folk music and exceptional talent. In the Armenian diaspora, Armenian revolutionary songs are popular with the youth.[citation needed] These songs encourage Armenian patriotism and are generally about Armenian history and national heroes.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of music is Richard Hagopian famous for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the traditional &quot;kef&quot; style</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What instruments does 'kef' use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments (often electrified/amplified) and some western instruments</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of music does Sirusho perform?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pop music combined with Armenian folk music</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What nationality is Charles Aznavour?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">French-Armenian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What US heavy metal band is comprised of Armenians?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">System of a Down</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Carpet-weaving is historically a major traditional profession for the majority of Armenian women, including many Armenian families.
