In the 1927 case Olmstead v. United States, in which a bootlegger was caught through telephone tapping, the United States Supreme Court ruled that FBI wiretaps did not violate the Fourth Amendment as unlawful search and seizure, as long as the FBI did not break into a person's home to complete the tapping. After Prohibition's repeal, Congress passed the Communications Act of 1934, which outlawed non-consensual phone tapping, but allowed bugging. In the 1939 case Nardone v. United States, the court ruled that due to the 1934 law, evidence the FBI obtained by phone tapping was inadmissible in court. After the 1967 case Katz v. United States overturned the 1927 case that had allowed bugging, Congress passed the Omnibus Crime Control Act, allowing public authorities to tap telephones during investigations as long as they obtain a warrant beforehand.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What tool did Hoover use to find bootleggers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">wiretapping</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what supreme court case was it ruled that FBI wiretaps did not violate the Fourth Amendment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Olmstead v.

Eight Nazi agents who had planned sabotage operations against American targets were arrested, and six were executed (Ex parte Quirin) under their sentences. Also during this time, a joint US/UK code-breaking effort (the Venona project)—with which the FBI was heavily involved—broke Soviet diplomatic and intelligence communications codes, allowing the US and British governments to read Soviet communications. This effort confirmed the existence of Americans working in the United States for Soviet intelligence. Hoover was administering this project but failed to notify the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) until 1952. Another notable case is the arrest of Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in 1957. The discovery of Soviet spies operating in the US allowed Hoover to pursue his longstanding obsession with the threat he perceived from the American Left, ranging from Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) union organizers to American liberals.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the FBI begin investigating espionage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1940s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Nazis were arrested?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eight</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What project broke Soviet codes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Venona project</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What agency did Hoover not tell about the code break and the discoveries gained from it?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">CIA</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 2003 a congressional committee called the FBI's organized crime informant program &quot;one of the greatest failures in the history of federal law enforcement.&quot; The FBI allowed four innocent men to be convicted of the March 1965 gangland murder of Edward &quot;Teddy&quot; Deegan in order to protect Vincent Flemmi, an FBI informant.

Technological innovation and the skills of FBI Laboratory analysts helped ensure that the three cases were successfully prosecuted. Justice Department investigations into the FBI's roles in the Ruby Ridge and Waco incidents were found to be obstructed by agents within the Bureau. During the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, the FBI was criticized for its investigation of the Centennial Olympic Park bombing.

The Post reported from Zegart's book that government documents show the CIA and FBI missed 23 potential chances to disrupt the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The primary reasons for the failures included: agency cultures resistant to change and new ideas; inappropriate incentives for promotion; and a lack of cooperation between the FBI, CIA and the rest of the United States Intelligence Community. The book blamed the FBI's decentralized structure, which prevented effective communication and cooperation among different FBI offices. The book suggested that the FBI has not evolved into an effective counter-terrorism or counter-intelligence agency, due in large part to deeply ingrained agency cultural resistance to change. For example, FBI personnel practices continue to treat all staff other than special agents as support staff, classifying intelligence analysts alongside the FBI's auto mechanics and janitors.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Washington Post publish excerpts from the book Spying Blind?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">July 8, 2007</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many chances to disrupt the 9/11 attacks did the FBI dismiss?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">23</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two agencies had a lack of co-operation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">FBI, CIA</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was to blame for the FBI's failure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">FBI's decentralized structure</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the FBI's decentralized structure prevent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">effective communication</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The USA PATRIOT Act increased the powers allotted to the FBI, especially in wiretapping and monitoring of Internet activity.

This project, originally scheduled to take three years and cost around $380 million, ended up going far over budget and behind schedule. Efforts to deploy modern computers and networking equipment were generally successful, but attempts to develop new investigation software, outsourced to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), were not. Virtual Case File, or VCF, as the software was known, was plagued by poorly defined goals, and repeated changes in management. In January 2005, more than two years after the software was originally planned for completion, the FBI officially abandoned the project. At least $100 million (and much more by some estimates) was spent on the project, which never became operational. The FBI has been forced to continue using its decade-old Automated Case Support system, which IT experts consider woefully inadequate.

Hoover was substantially involved in most major cases and projects that the FBI handled during his tenure. After Hoover's death, Congress passed legislation that limited the tenure of future FBI Directors to ten years.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Director from 1924 to 1972?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">J.

The majority of the names on the list belonged to Issei community leaders, as the FBI investigation built on an existing Naval Intelligence index that had focused on Japanese Americans in Hawaii and the West Coast, but many German and Italian nationals also found their way onto the secret list. Robert Shivers, head of the Honolulu office, obtained permission from Hoover to start detaining those on the list on December 7, 1941, while bombs were still falling over Pearl Harbor. Mass arrests and searches of homes (in most cases conducted without warrants) began a few hours after the attack, and over the next several weeks more than 5,500 Issei men were taken into FBI custody. On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast. FBI Director Hoover opposed the subsequent mass removal and confinement of Japanese Americans authorized under Executive Order 9066, but Roosevelt prevailed. The vast majority went along with the subsequent exclusion orders, but in a handful of cases where Japanese Americans refused to obey the new military regulations, FBI agents handled their arrests. The Bureau continued surveillance on Japanese Americans throughout the war, conducting background checks on applicants for resettlement outside camp, and entering the camps (usually without the permission of War Relocation Authority officials) and grooming informants in order to monitor dissidents and &quot;troublemakers.&quot; After the war, the FBI was assigned to protect returning Japanese Americans from attacks by hostile white communities.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Bureau begin compiling a custodial detention list?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1939</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When would the people on the custodial detention list be arrested?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in the event of war with Axis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the majority of names on the custodial detention list?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Issei community leaders</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Pearl Harbor bombed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">December 7, 1941</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group did the FBI continue surveillance on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Japanese Americans</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In response to organized crime, on August 25, 1953, the FBI created the Top Hoodlum Program. The national office directed field offices to gather information on mobsters in their territories and to report it regularly to Washington for a centralized collection of intelligence on racketeers. After the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO Act, took effect, the FBI began investigating the former Prohibition-organized groups, which had become fronts for crime in major cities and small towns. All of the FBI work was done undercover and from within these organizations, using the provisions provided in the RICO Act. Gradually the agency dismantled many of the groups. Although Hoover initially denied the existence of a National Crime Syndicate in the United States, the Bureau later conducted operations against known organized crime syndicates and families, including those headed by Sam Giancana and John Gotti.

The Associated Press reported in mid-January 2005 that the FBI essentially abandoned the use of Carnivore in 2001, in favor of commercially available software, such as NarusInsight.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the electronic eavesdropping system used by the FBI during the Clinton presidency?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Carnivore</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Carnivore monitor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">email and electronic communications</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Carnivore renamed to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">DCS1000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the FBI abandon Carnivore?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2001</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of software replaced Carnivore?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">commercially available</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>FBI Directors are appointed by the President of the United States. They must be confirmed by the United States Senate and serve a term of office of five years, with a maximum of ten years, if reappointed, unless they resign or are fired by the President before their term ends. J. Edgar Hoover, appointed by Calvin Coolidge in 1924, was by far the longest-serving director, serving until his death in 1972. In 1968, Congress passed legislation as part of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act Pub.L. 90–351, June 19, 1968, 82 Stat. 197 that specified a 10-year limit, a maximum of two 5-year terms, for future FBI Directors, as well as requiring Senate confirmation of appointees. As the incumbent, this legislation did not apply to Hoover, only to his successors. The current FBI Director is James B. Comey, who was appointed in 2013 by Barack Obama.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who appoints FBI directors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">President of the United States</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What legislative body confirms FBI directors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United States Senate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long is the term of a FBI director?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What made Hoover stop serving as the FBI Director?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his death</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the current FBI director?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">James B.

The bureau has participated to varying degrees, which has ranged from direct involvement in the creative process of film or TV series development, to providing consultation on operations and closed cases. A few of the notable portrayals of the FBI on television are the 1993-2002 series The X-Files, which concerned investigations into paranormal phenomena by five fictional Special Agents and the fictional Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) agency in the TV drama 24, which is patterned after the FBI Counterterrorism Division. The 1991 movie Point Break is based on the true story of an undercover FBI agent who infiltrated a gang of bank robbers. The 1997 movie Donnie Brasco is based on the true story of undercover FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone infiltrating the Mafia.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the FBI first appear in popular media?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1930s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What notable TV show was concerned with FBI investigations of the paranormal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">X-Files</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the TV drama 24 designed on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">FBI Counterterrorism Division</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the movie Point Break Based on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">undercover FBI agent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the movie Donnie Brasco based on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Joseph D.

Samuel Walker, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska Omaha said the number of shots found to be unjustified was &quot;suspiciously low.&quot; In the same time period, the FBI wounded 150 people, 70 of whom died; the FBI found all 150 shootings to be justified. Likewise, during the period from 2011 to the present, all shootings by FBI agents have been found to be justified by internal investigation. In a 2002 case in Maryland, an innocent man was shot, and later paid $1.3 million by the FBI after agents mistook him for a bank robber; the internal investigation found that the shooting was justified, based on the man's actions.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many times did FBI agents first their weapons from 1993 to 2011?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">289</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many times were FBI shots not justified?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5 cases</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people were wounded in the cases where FBI shooting was not justified?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">none</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Samuel Walker describe the number of unjustified shots fired?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">suspiciously low</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what was the shooting of an innocent Maryland man deemed justified?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the man's actions</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 2005, fugitive Puerto Rican Nationalist leader Filiberto Ojeda Ríos died in a gun battle with FBI agents in 2005 in what some charged was an assassination.[citation needed] Puerto Rico Governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá criticized the FBI assault as &quot;improper&quot; and &quot;highly irregular&quot; and demanded to know why his government was not informed of it. The FBI refused to release information beyond the official press release, citing security and agent privacy issues. The Puerto Rico Justice Department filed suit in federal court against the FBI and the US Attorney General, demanding information crucial to the Commonwealth's own investigation of the incident. The case was dismissed by the U.S Supreme Court. Ojeda Rios' funeral was attended by a long list of dignitaries, including the highest authority of the Roman Catholic Church in Puerto Rico, Archbishop Roberto Octavio González Nieves, ex-Governor Rafael Hernández Colón, and numerous other personalities.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Puerto Rican Nationalist Filiberto Ojeda Ríos die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2005</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who killed Filiberto Ojeda Ríos?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">FBI agents</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did some people describe Filiberto Ojeda Ríos's death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">assassination</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the FBI respond to requests to release information beyond the initial press release?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The FBI refused</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What US court dismissed the Puerto Rican case for information crucial to their own investigation of Filiberto Ojeda Ríos's killing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Supreme Court</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
