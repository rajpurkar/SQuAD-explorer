At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most non-metallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as in the form of water or organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions as many acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., anion) when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex species than that would suggest. As the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What form can you find hydrogen is on Earth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">molecular</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the molecular make-up of hydrogen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">H2</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are three properties of hydrogen at normal temperature and normal pressure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">colorless, odorless, tasteless</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What charge does hydrogen display in ionic compounds when it is called a hydride?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">negative</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What field of study has hydrogen and it's properties played a key role in development?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">quantum mechanics</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century, via the mixing of metals with acids.

At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen gas contains about 25% of the para form and 75% of the ortho form, also known as the &quot;normal form&quot;. The equilibrium ratio of orthohydrogen to parahydrogen depends on temperature, but because the ortho form is an excited state and has a higher energy than the para form, it is unstable and cannot be purified. At very low temperatures, the equilibrium state is composed almost exclusively of the para form. The liquid and gas phase thermal properties of pure parahydrogen differ significantly from those of the normal form because of differences in rotational heat capacities, as discussed more fully in spin isomers of hydrogen.
