Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, being turned into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal) which was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585. In 711, the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula, taking the Visigoth kingdom, but soon in 740 Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias. During the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings, but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom of Leon and later to that of Castile, while maintaining its own legal and customary practices and personality. From the 13th century on, the kings of Castile, as kings of Galicia, appointed an Adiantado-mór, whose attributions passed to the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galiza from the last years of the 15th century. The Governor also presided the Real Audiencia do Reino de Galicia, a royal tribunal and government body. From the 16th century, the representation and voice of the kingdom was held by an assembly of deputies and representatives of the cities of the kingdom, the Cortes or Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia, an institution which was forcibly discontinued in 1833 when the kingdom was divided into four administrative provinces with no legal mutual links. During the 19th and 20th centuries, demand grew for self-government and for the recognition of the personality of Galicia, a demand which led to the frustrated Statute of Autonomy of 1936, and to the Statute of Autonomy of 1981, currently in force.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During which period did humans first inhabit Galicia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Middle Paleolithic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does its name come from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gallaeci, the Celtic peoples</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which empire turned Galicia into one of its provinces the 3rd century AD?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Roman Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the assembly of representatives that began in the 16th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Cortes or Junta</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which year was the current Statute of Autonomy enacted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1981</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The interior of Galicia is characterized by its hilly landscape, although mountain ranges rise to 2,000 m (6,600 ft) in the east and south. The coastal areas are mostly an alternate series of rías (submerged valleys where the sea penetrates tens of kilometres inland) and cliffs. The climate of Galicia is temperate and rainy, but it is also markedly drier in the summer, being usually classified as Oceanic in the west and north, and Mediterranean in the southeast. Its topographic and climatic conditions have made animal husbandry and farming the primary source of Galicia's wealth for most of its history. With the exception of shipbuilding and food processing, Galicia was largely a semi-subsistence farming and fishing economy and did not experience significant industrialization until after the mid-20th century. In 2012, the gross domestic product at purchasing power parity was €56,000 million, with a nominal GDP per capita of €20,700. The population is largely concentrated in two coastal areas: from Ferrol to A Coruña in the northwest and from Pontevedra to Vigo in the southwest. To a lesser extent, there are smaller populations around the interior cities of Lugo, Ourense and Santiago de Compostela. The political capital is Santiago de Compostela, in the province of A Coruña. Vigo, in the province of Pontevedra, is the most populous municipality with 294,997 (2014), while A Coruña is the most populous city with 215.227 (2014).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How high does Galicia's mountain ranges rise?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2,000 m (6,600 ft)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What have been its two primary sources of wealth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">animal husbandry and farming</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Name its northwestern coastal area.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ferrol to A Coruña</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Name its political capital.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Santiago de Compostela</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which province is this capital in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">A Coruña</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The name evolved during the Middle Ages from Gallaecia, sometimes written Galletia, to Gallicia.

Thousands of Megalithic tumuli are distributed throughout the country, but mostly along the coastal areas. Within each tumulus is a stone burial chamber known locally as anta (dolmen), frequently preceded by a corridor. Galicia was later fully affected by the Bell Beaker culture. While its rich mineral deposits - tin and gold - led to the development of Bronze Age metallurgy, and to the commerce of bronze and gold items all along the Atlantic façade of Western Europe, where a common elite's culture evolved during the Atlantic Bronze Age.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where in Galicia has the oldest evidence of humans been found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eirós Cave</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which municipality is this in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Triacastela</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the oldest culture whose structures have been found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Megalithic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two minerals found in abundance in Galicia were used during Bronze Age?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tin and gold</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Castro culture ('Culture of the Castles') developed during the Iron Age, and flourished during the second half of the first millennium BC.

Under Roman rule, most Galician hillforts began to be – sometimes forcibly – abandoned, and Gallaeci served frequently in the Roman army as auxiliary troops. Romans brought new technologies, new travel routes, new forms of organizing property, and a new language; latin. The Roman Empire established its control over Galicia through camps (castra) as Aquis Querquennis, Ciadella camp or Lucus Augusti (Lugo), roads (viae) and monuments as the lighthouse known as Tower of Hercules, in Corunna, but the remoteness and lesser interest of the country since the 2nd century of our era, when the gold mines stopped being productive, led to a lesser degree of Romanization.

Its progress towards the Iberian Peninsula forced the Roman authorities to establish a treaty (foedus) by which the Suebi would settle peacefully and govern Galicia as imperial allies. So, from 409 Galicia was taken by the Suebi, forming the first medieval kingdom to be created in Europe, in 411, even before the fall of the Roman Empire, being also the first Germanic kingdom to mint coinage in Roman lands. During this period a Briton colony and bishopric (see Mailoc) was established in Northern Galicia (Britonia), probably as foederati and allies of the Suebi.

Soon after, in the late 15th century, in the dynastic conflict between Isabella I of Castile and Joanna La Beltraneja, part of the Galician aristocracy supported Joanna. After Isabella's victory, she initiated an administrative and political reform which the chronicler Jeronimo Zurita defined as &quot;doma del Reino de Galicia&quot;: 'It was then when the taming of Galicia began, because not just the local lords and knights, but all the people of that nation were the ones against the others very bold and warlike'. These reforms, while establishing a local government and tribunal (the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia) and bringing the nobleman under submission, also brought most Galician monasteries and institutions under Castilian control, in what has been criticized as a process of centralisation. At the same time the kings began to call the Xunta or Cortes of the Kingdom of Galicia, an assembly of deputies or representatives of the cities of the Kingdom, to ask for monetary and military contributions. This assembly soon developed into the voice and legal representation of the Kingdom, and the depositary of its will and laws.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Social turmoil led to conflict?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Guerras Irmandiñas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two royals were part of the dynastic conflict of the 15th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Isabella I of Castile and Joanna La Beltraneja</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The subsequent reforms were coined as &quot;doma del Reino de Galicia&quot; by who?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jeronimo Zurita</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the local government and tribunal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The modern period of the kingdom of Galicia began with the murder or defeat of some of the most powerful Galician lords, such as Pedro Álvarez de Sotomayor, called Pedro Madruga, and Rodrigo Henriquez Osorio, at the hands of the Castilian armies sent to Galicia between the years 1480 and 1486.

The most famous assaults were upon the city of Vigo by Sir Francis Drake in 1585 and 1589, and the siege of A Coruña in 1589 by the English Armada. Galicia also suffered occasional slave raids by Barbary pirates, but not as frequently as the Mediterranean coastal areas. The most famous Barbary attack was the bloody sack of the town of Cangas in 1617. At the time, the king's petitions for money and troops became more frequent, due to the human and economic exhaustion of Castile; the Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia (the local Cortes or representative assembly) was initially receptive to these petitions, raising large sums, accepting the conscription of the men of the kingdom, and even commissioning a new naval squadron which was sustained with the incomes of the Kingdom.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Sir Francis Drake attack in 1585 and again in 1589?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vigo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who attacked Cangas in 1617?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Barbary pirates</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After the rupture of the wars with Portugal and Catalonia, the Junta changed its attitude, this time due to the exhaustion of Galicia, now involved not just in naval or oversea operations, but also in an exhausting war with the Portuguese, war which produced thousands of casualties and refugees and was heavily disturbing to the local economy and commerce. So, in the second half of the 17th century the Junta frequently denied or considerably reduced the initial petitions of the monarch, and though the tension didn't rise to the levels experienced in Portugal or Catalonia, there were frequent urban mutinies and some voices even asked for the secession of the Kingdom of Galicia.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">War broke out with which other countries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Portugal and Catalonia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Galician Junta more often stand up to requests from the monarch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">second half of the 17th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what way was the tension between the monarch and Galicia similar to the wars it was fighting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">there were frequent urban mutinies</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the early 20th century came another turn toward nationalist politics with Solidaridad Gallega (1907–1912) modeled on Solidaritat Catalana in Catalonia.
