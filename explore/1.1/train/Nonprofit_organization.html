A nonprofit organization is often dedicated to furthering a particular social cause or advocating for a particular point of view. In economic terms, a nonprofit organization uses its surplus revenues to further achieve its purpose or mission, rather than distributing its surplus income to the organization's shareholders (or equivalents) as profit or dividends. This is known as the distribution constraint. The decision to adopt a nonprofit legal structure is one that will often have taxation implications, particularly where the nonprofit seeks income tax exemption, charitable status and so on.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the purpose of an NPO?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">A nonprofit organization (NPO, also known as a non-business entity) is an organization whose purposes are other than making a profit.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does an NPO do with it's surplus income?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">In economic terms, a nonprofit organization uses its surplus revenues to further achieve its purpose or mission</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the constraint's upon an NPO's financial distributions called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the distribution constraint</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the definition of a non-profit organization?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">purposes are other than making a profit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an NPO also known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">non-business entity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the purpose of an NPO?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">furthering a particular social cause or advocating for a particular point of view</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does a non-profit do with the money it takes in, instead of using it for a profit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">further achieve its purpose or mission, rather than distributing its surplus income to the organization's shareholders (or equivalents) as profit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is it called when a non-profit uses it's money as it should?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">distribution constraint</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The nonprofit landscape is highly varied, although many people have come to associate NPOs with charitable organizations. Although charities do comprise an often high profile or visible aspect of the sector, there are many other types of nonprofits. Overall, they tend to be either member-serving or community-serving. Member-serving organizations include mutual societies, cooperatives, trade unions, credit unions, industry associations, sports clubs, retired serviceman's clubs and peak bodies – organizations that benefit a particular group of people i.e. the members of the organization. Typically, community-serving organizations are focused on providing services to the community in general, either globally or locally: organizations delivering human services programs or projects, aid and development programs, medical research, education and health services, and so on. It could be argued many nonprofits sit across both camps, at least in terms of the impact they make. For example, the grassroots support group that provides a lifeline to those with a particular condition or disease could be deemed to be serving both its members (by directly supporting them) and the broader community (through the provision of a helping service for fellow citizens).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What types of organizations are NPOs usually associated with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">charitable</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who does an NPO usually serve?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">member-serving or community-serving</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do NPOs that center around community usually focus on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">providing services to the community in general, either globally or locally</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are member serving NPOs really focused on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by directly supporting them</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are community serving NPOs focused on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a helping service for fellow citizens</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although NPOs are permitted to generate surplus revenues, they must be retained by the organization for its self-preservation, expansion, or plans.

A membership organization elects the board and has regular meetings and the power to amend the bylaws. A board-only organization typically has a self-selected board, and a membership whose powers are limited to those delegated to it by the board. A board-only organization's bylaws may even state that the organization does not have any membership, although the organization's literature may refer to its donors or service recipients as &quot;members&quot;; examples of such organizations are Fairvote and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. The Model Nonprofit Corporation Act imposes many complexities and requirements on membership decision-making. Accordingly, many organizations, such as Wikimedia, have formed board-only structures. The National Association of Parliamentarians has generated concerns about the implications of this trend for the future of openness, accountability, and understanding of public concerns in nonprofit organizations. Specifically, they note that nonprofit organizations, unlike business corporations, are not subject to market discipline for products and shareholder discipline of their capital; therefore, without membership control of major decisions such as election of the board, there are few inherent safeguards against abuse. A rebuttal to this might be that as nonprofit organizations grow and seek larger donations, the degree of scrutiny increases, including expectations of audited financial statements. A further rebuttal might be that NPOs are constrained, by their choice of legal structure, from financial benefit as far as distribution of profit to its members/directors is concerned. Beware of board-only organizations- review the board members annual income before donating, such as the Clinton Foundation. Board members who decide what percentage of your donations will increase their personal wealth are rampant in abusing this designation of an NPO, and this is why they attempt to avoid audits and use a double bottom line for taxing.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the two top types of NPOs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">membership and board-only</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is a membership organization run?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">elects the board and has regular meetings and the power to amend the bylaws</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is a board only organization run?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">self-selected board, and a membership whose powers are limited to those delegated to it by the board</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a further constraint of an NPO, depending on their legal structure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">financial benefit as far as distribution of profit to its members/directors is concerned</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What should one be aware of when dealing with a board run NPO?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Board members who decide what percentage of your donations will increase their personal wealth are rampant in abusing this designation</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Canada allows nonprofits to be incorporated or unincorporated. Nonprofits may incorporate either federally, under Part II of the Canada Business Corporations Act or under provincial legislation. Many of the governing Acts for Canadian nonprofits date to the early 1900s, meaning that nonprofit legislation has not kept pace with legislation that governs for-profit corporations; particularly with regards to corporate governance. Federal, and in some provinces (such as Ontario), incorporation is by way of Letters Patent, and any change to the Letters Patent (even a simple name change) requires formal approval by the appropriate government, as do by-law changes.

The IRS, after reviewing the application to ensure the organization meets the conditions to be recognized as a tax exempt organization (such as the purpose, limitations on spending, and internal safeguards for a charity), may issue an authorization letter to the nonprofit granting it tax exempt status for income tax payment, filing, and deductibility purposes. The exemption does not apply to other Federal taxes such as employment taxes. Additionally, a tax-exempt organization must pay federal tax on income that is unrelated to their exempt purpose.

Most rely on external funding (government funds, grants from charitable foundations, direct donations) to maintain their operations and changes in these sources of revenue may influence the reliability or predictability with which the organization can hire and retain staff, sustain facilities, create programs, or maintain tax-exempt status. For example, a university that sells research to for-profit companies may have tax exemption problems. In addition, unreliable funding, long hours and low pay can result in employee retention problems. During 2009, the US government acknowledged this critical need by the inclusion of the Nonprofit Capacity Building Program in the Serve America Act. Further efforts to quantify the scope of the sector and propose policy solutions for community benefit were included in the Nonprofit Sector and Community Solutions Act, proposed during 2010.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are ways that a charitable foundation receives money for it's cause?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">government funds, grants from charitable foundations, direct donations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of funding do charitable organizations typically rely on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">external funding</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some problems that affect employee retention and volunteers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unreliable funding, long hours and low pay</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What legislation did the US introduce to try and help the NPOs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nonprofit Capacity Building Program</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Nonprofit Sector and Community Solutions Act adopted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2010</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In Australia, nonprofit organisations include trade unions, charitable entities, co-operatives, universities and hospitals, mutual societies, grass-root and support groups, political parties, religious groups, incorporated associations, not-for-profit companies, trusts and more. Furthermore, they operate across a multitude of domains and industries, from health, employment, disability and other human services to local sporting clubs, credit unions and research institutes. A nonprofit organisation in Australia can choose from a number of legal forms depending on the needs and activities of the organisation: co-operative, company limited by guarantee, unincorporated association, incorporated association (by the Associations Incorporation Act 1985) or incorporated association or council (by the Commonwealth Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976). From an academic perspective, social enterprise is for the most part considered a sub-set of the nonprofit sector as typically they too are concerned with a purpose relating to a public good, however these are not bound to adhere to a nonprofit legal structure and many incorporate and operate as for-profit entities.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the biggest concern of non-profits in Australia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a purpose relating to a public good</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Commonwealth Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act adopted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1976</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Associations Incorporation Act adopted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1985</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the Associations Incorporation Act cover?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">incorporated association</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who covers incorporated associations or councils?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Commonwealth Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Many nonprofit organizations find it difficult to create consistent messaging that resonates with their various stakeholders as marketing budgets are minimal or nonexistent.

Liabilities promised on the full faith and credit of the organization but not recorded anywhere constitute accounting fraud.
