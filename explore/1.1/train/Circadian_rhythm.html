They thus enable organisms to best capitalize on environmental resources (e.g. light and food) compared to those that cannot predict such availability. It has therefore been suggested that circadian rhythms put organisms at a selective advantage in evolutionary terms. However, rhythmicity appears to be as important in regulating and coordinating internal metabolic processes, as in coordinating with the environment. This is suggested by the maintenance (heritability) of circadian rhythms in fruit flies after several hundred generations in constant laboratory conditions, as well as in creatures in constant darkness in the wild, and by the experimental elimination of behavioral, but not physiological, circadian rhythms in quail.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For what do Circadian rhythms let an organism prepare?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">environmental changes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can an organism that uses circadian rhythms use to its advantage that others can not?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">resources</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By better using resources, how does that improve an organism's chances of surviving?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">selective advantage</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By improving what processes does the use of circadian rhythms serve to benefit the individual?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">internal metabolic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What insect has been studied concerning the inheritability of rhythms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fruit flies</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Norwegian researchers at the University of Tromsø have shown that some Arctic animals (ptarmigan, reindeer) show circadian rhythms only in the parts of the year that have daily sunrises and sunsets.

The morning loop consists of CCA1 (Circadian and Clock-Associated 1) and LHY (Late Elongated Hypocotyl), which encode closely related MYB transcription factors that regulate circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis, as well as PRR 7 and 9 (Pseudo-Response Regulators.) The evening loop consists of GI (Gigantea) and ELF4, both involved in regulation of flowering time genes. When CCA1 and LHY are overexpressed (under constant light or dark conditions), plants become arrhythmic, and mRNA signals reduce, contributing to a negative feedback loop. Gene expression of CCA1 and LHY oscillates and peaks in the early morning, whereas TOC1 gene expression oscillates and peaks in the early evening. While it was previously hypothesised that these three genes model a negative feedback loop in which over-expressed CCA1 and LHY repress TOC1 and over-expressed TOC1 is a positive regulator of CCA1 and LHY, it was shown in 2012 by Andrew Millar and others that TOC1 in fact serves as a repressor not only of CCA1, LHY, and PRR7 and 9 in the morning loop but also of GI and ELF4 in the evening loop. This finding and further computational modeling of TOC1 gene functions and interactions suggest a reframing of the plant circadian clock as a triple negative-component repressilator model rather than the positive/negative-element feedback loop characterizing the clock in mammals.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What produces a self-sustaining rhythm?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">central oscillator</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When do the CCA1  and LHY function?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">morning</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which loop that consists of GI and ELF4 functions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">evening</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the previous belief of feedback in the gene loop?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">negative feedback loop</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What researcher showed that the gene  feedback loop serves as a repressor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Andrew Millar</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A defect in the human homologue of the Drosophila &quot;period&quot; gene was identified as a cause of the sleep disorder FASPS (Familial advanced sleep phase syndrome), underscoring the conserved nature of the molecular circadian clock through evolution.

Behaviors showing rhythms include leaf movement, growth, germination, stomatal/gas exchange, enzyme activity, photosynthetic activity, and fragrance emission, among others. Circadian rhythms occur as a plant entrains to synchronize with the light cycle of its surrounding environment. These rhythms are endogenously generated and self-sustaining and are relatively constant over a range of ambient temperatures. Important features include two interacting transcription-translation feedback loops: proteins containing PAS domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions; and several photoreceptors that fine-tune the clock to different light conditions. Anticipation of changes in the environment allows appropriate changes in a plant's physiological state, conferring an adaptive advantage. A better understanding of plant circadian rhythms has applications in agriculture, such as helping farmers stagger crop harvests to extend crop availability and securing against massive losses due to weather.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the plant expression of circadian rhythm?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">when to flower</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do plants need to attract to their flowering?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pollinators</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> With what feature of environment do plants need to be in sync?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">light cycle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does adaptive advantage allow for plants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Anticipation of changes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where can an understanding of circadian rhythms of plants be an advantage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">agriculture</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The simplest known circadian clock is that of the prokaryotic cyanobacteria.

Both DLMO and the midpoint (in time) of the presence of the hormone in the blood or saliva have been used as circadian markers. However, newer research indicates that the melatonin offset may be the more reliable marker. Benloucif et al. found that melatonin phase markers were more stable and more highly correlated with the timing of sleep than the core temperature minimum. They found that both sleep offset and melatonin offset are more strongly correlated with phase markers than the onset of sleep.

In the early 20th century, circadian rhythms were noticed in the rhythmic feeding times of bees. Extensive experiments were done by Auguste Forel, Ingeborg Beling, and Oskar Wahl to see whether this rhythm was due to an endogenous clock.[citation needed] Ron Konopka and Seymour Benzer isolated the first clock mutant in Drosophila in the early 1970s and mapped the &quot;period&quot; gene, the first discovered genetic determinant of behavioral rhythmicity. Joseph Takahashi discovered the first mammalian circadian clock mutation (clockΔ19) using mice in 1994.

This was shown by Gene Block in isolated mollusk BRNs.[clarification needed] At the same time, different cells may communicate with each other resulting in a synchronised output of electrical signaling. These may interface with endocrine glands of the brain to result in periodic release of hormones. The receptors for these hormones may be located far across the body and synchronise the peripheral clocks of various organs. Thus, the information of the time of the day as relayed by the eyes travels to the clock in the brain, and, through that, clocks in the rest of the body may be synchronised. This is how the timing of, for example, sleep/wake, body temperature, thirst, and appetite are coordinately controlled by the biological clock.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Inside of what can the molecular circadian clock operate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">single cell</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By functioning within a single, what is the system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cell-autonomous</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What section of the brain periodically releases hormones?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">endocrine glands</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are sleep and wake cycles as well as body functions coordinated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">biological clock</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do body hormone receptors do with the body's organs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">synchronise</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Light is the signal by which plants synchronize their internal clocks to their environment and is sensed by a wide variety of photoreceptors. Red and blue light are absorbed through several phytochromes and cryptochromes. One phytochrome, phyA, is the main phytochrome in seedlings grown in the dark but rapidly degrades in light to produce Cry1. Phytochromes B–E are more stable with phyB, the main phytochrome in seedlings grown in the light. The cryptochrome (cry) gene is also a light-sensitive component of the circadian clock and is thought to be involved both as a photoreceptor and as part of the clock's endogenous pacemaker mechanism. Cryptochromes 1–2 (involved in blue–UVA) help to maintain the period length in the clock through a whole range of light conditions.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What signals plants to synchronize their internal clocks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Light</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do plants use to sense light?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">photoreceptors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What receptors absorb red and blue light in plants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">phytochromes and cryptochromes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which phytochrome found in seedlings deteriorates with light and growth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">phyA</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the main phytochrome found in seedling grown in light?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">phyB</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Studies by Nathaniel Kleitman in 1938 and by Derk-Jan Dijk and Charles Czeisler in the 1990s put human subjects on enforced 28-hour sleep–wake cycles, in constant dim light and with other time cues suppressed, for over a month.

Previous hypotheses emphasized that photosensitive proteins and circadian rhythms may have originated together in the earliest cells, with the purpose of protecting replicating DNA from high levels of damaging ultraviolet radiation during the daytime. As a result, replication was relegated to the dark. However, evidence for this is lacking, since the simplest organisms with a circadian rhythm, the cyanobacteria, do the opposite of this - they divide more in the daytime. Recent studies instead highlight the importance of co-evolution of redox proteins with circadian oscillators in all three kingdoms of life following the Great Oxidation Event approximately 2.3 billion years ago. The current view is that circadian changes in environmental oxygen levels and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of daylight are likely to have driven a need to evolve circadian rhythms to preempt, and therefore counteract, damaging redox reactions on a daily basis.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is theorized to have evolved with circadian rhythms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">photosensitive proteins</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is thought that circadian rhythm evolved to protect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">replicating DNA</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what did  DNA need to be protected in the earliest cells? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ultraviolet radiation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">One possible reason for the development of the circadian system is the need to counteract what ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">redox reactions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What environmental event occurred 2.3 million years ago?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Great Oxidation Event</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Mutations or deletions of clock gene in mice have demonstrated the importance of body clocks to ensure the proper timing of cellular/metabolic events; clock-mutant mice are hyperphagic and obese, and have altered glucose metabolism.
