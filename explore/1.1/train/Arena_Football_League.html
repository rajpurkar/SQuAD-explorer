It was founded in 1987 by Jim Foster, making it the third longest-running professional football league in North America, after the Canadian Football League and the National Football League. It is played indoors on a 68-yard field (about half the distance of an NFL field), resulting in a faster-paced and higher-scoring game. The sport was invented in the early 1980s and patented by Foster, a former executive of the United States Football League and the National Football League.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the football league established?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1987</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is football played?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">indoors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does AFL sand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arena Football League</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded The AFL?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jim Foster</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the AFL founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1987</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what decade was AFL sport invented?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1980s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the founder of the Arena Football League?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jim Foster</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the inaugural year of the AFL?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1987</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does the Arena Football League rank amongst professional football leagues in North America by longevity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">third</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In yards, how large is an arena football field?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">68</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What fraction of the size of an NFL football field is an arena football field?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">half</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>For its 2015 season, the league consisted of 12 teams, all from the United States; however, upon the completion of the regular season, the league announced that the two teams it had assumed operation of during the season would cease all operations effective immediately; a regular season game slated between the two had previously been canceled and declared a tie.

The 2015 season started during the last week of March and ran weekly into late August. At the end of the regular season, all teams from each conference (the conference winner and three wild card teams) play in the AFL playoffs, an eight-team single-elimination tournament that culminates with the championship game, known as the ArenaBowl. From 1987 to 2004, 2010 and 2011 and again starting in 2014, the game was played at the site of the higher seeded team. From 2005 to 2008, the games were at neutral sites, Las Vegas and New Orleans. In 2012, the league championship returned to a neutral site and ArenaBowl XXV was held at the New Orleans Arena; ArenaBowl XXVI was held in Orlando.

While many sports commentators and fans continued to ridicule the league, Warner's story gave the league positive exposure, and it brought the league a new television deal with TNN, which, unlike ESPN, televised regular season games live. While it was not financially lucrative, it helped set the stage for what the league would become in the new millennium. Also, the year also brought a spin-off league, the AF2, intended to be a developmental league, comparable to the National Football League's NFL Europe. There was a lot of expansion in the 2000s. Expansion teams included the Austin Wranglers, Carolina Cobras, Los Angeles Avengers, Chicago Rush, Detroit Fury, Dallas Desperados, Colorado Crush, New Orleans VooDoo, Philadelphia Soul, Nashville Kats, Kansas City Brigade, New York Dragons and Utah Blaze. Some of these teams, including the Crush, Desperados, Kats, and VooDoo, were owned by the same group which owned the NFL teams in their host cities.

After their successful trip to China to help promote the game, they formally announced plans to further develop AFL China by the fall of 2014 by starting a comprehensive training program in May 2013 with exhibition games planned for the cities of Beijing and Guangzhou in October. This is the first time professional football of any kind will be played in China with the support of the Chinese government and the CRFA (Chinese Rugby Football Association). Key persons involved include founder and CEO. Martin E. Judge, partner Ron Jaworski, CAFL CEO Gary Morris and president David Niu.

In 2006, because of the XX Winter Olympic Games, the Stanley Cup playoffs and the Daytona 500, NBC scaled back from weekly coverage to scattered coverage during the regular season, but committed to a full playoff schedule ending with the 20th ArenaBowl. NBC and the Arena Football League officially severed ties on June 30, 2006, having failed to reach a new broadcast deal.
