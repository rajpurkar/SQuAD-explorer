However, the scope of federal preemption is limited because the scope of federal power is not universal. In the dual-sovereign system of American federalism (actually tripartite because of the presence of Indian reservations), states are the plenary sovereigns, each with their own constitution, while the federal sovereign possesses only the limited supreme authority enumerated in the Constitution. Indeed, states may grant their citizens broader rights than the federal Constitution as long as they do not infringe on any federal constitutional rights. Thus, most U.S. law (especially the actual &quot;living law&quot; of contract, tort, property, criminal, and family law experienced by the majority of citizens on a day-to-day basis) consists primarily of state law, which can and does vary greatly from one state to the next.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What comes before state and territorial laws in the 50 U.S states?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Federal law and treaties</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Federal sovereign only possess authority if it is stated in what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Constitution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">States may grant their citizens border rights as long as they do not infringe on what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">federal constitutional rights</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Most U.S law, the kind of law we live everyday, consists of what kind of law?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">state law</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Does every state have the same laws?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">vary greatly from one state to the next.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Federal law overrides what laws?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">conflicting state and territorial laws</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The scope of federal power is not what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">universal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of system is American Federalism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dual-sovereign system</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">American Federalism can also be considered tripartite because of the presence of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Indian reservations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">States can grant their people broader rights than those granted in what document?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the federal Constitution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is there anything that trumps state law?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Federal law and treaties</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many state make up the United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">50</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Can states grant rights to citizens that are not defined by the constitution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">as long as they do not infringe on any federal constitutional rights</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is day-to-day, operational law considered?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;living law&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is living law mostly made up of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">state law</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Notably, a statute does not disappear automatically merely because it has been found unconstitutional; it must be deleted by a subsequent statute.

Traynor of the Supreme Court of California threw away legal fictions based on warranties and imposed strict liability for defective products as a matter of public policy in the landmark case of Greenman v. Yuba Power Products. The American Law Institute subsequently adopted a slightly different version of the Greenman rule in Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which was published in 1964 and was very influential throughout the United States.

Some reception statutes impose a specific cutoff date for reception, such as the date of a colony's founding, while others are deliberately vague.

This was because appellate decisions from many American courts were not regularly reported until the mid-19th century; lawyers and judges, as creatures of habit, used English legal materials to fill the gap. But citations to English decisions gradually disappeared during the 19th century as American courts developed their own principles to resolve the legal problems of the American people.

Since the start of the 20th century, broad interpretations of the Commerce and Spending Clauses of the Constitution have enabled federal law to expand into areas like aviation, telecommunications, railroads, pharmaceuticals, antitrust, and trademarks. In some areas, like aviation and railroads, the federal government has developed a comprehensive scheme that preempts virtually all state law, while in others, like family law, a relatively small number of federal statutes (generally covering interstate and international situations) interacts with a much larger body of state law. In areas like antitrust, trademark, and employment law, there are powerful laws at both the federal and state levels that coexist with each other. In a handful of areas like insurance, Congress has enacted laws expressly refusing to regulate them as long as the states have laws regulating them (see, e.g., the McCarran-Ferguson Act).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What areas of the Constitution deal with issuses such as aviation, railroads, and trademarks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Commerce and Spending Clauses</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In areas of law such as insurance, there are laws refusing to regulate them as long as states have laws doing what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">regulating them</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of property are trademarks and copyrights?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">intellectual property</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What governs things such as military, money, foreign relations, etc.?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">federal law</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What enabled federal law to begin expanding into other areas such as avaition, telecommunications, railroads, etc.?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Commerce and Spending Clauses of the Constitution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Commerce and Spending Clauses of the Constitution allow federal power to begin expanding?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">start of the 20th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a law enacted by Congress that states that it refuses to regulate some industries as long as the states have regulations in place already?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">McCarran-Ferguson Act</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happens when both the federal and state governments have regulations that overlap?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">coexist with each other</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After the President signs a bill into law (or Congress enacts it over his veto), it is delivered to the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) where it is assigned a law number, and prepared for publication as a slip law.

State laws have dramatically diverged in the centuries since independence, to the extent that the United States cannot be regarded as one legal system as to the majority of types of law traditionally under state control, but must be regarded as 50 separate systems of tort law, family law, property law, contract law, criminal law, and so on.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does each state posess?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">state constitutions, state governments, and state courts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the 50 states in the Union known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">separate sovereigns</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which ranch applies, interprets, and occasionally overturns both state statutes and regulations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">judicial branch</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What branch of government enacts state statutes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">legislative branch</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which branch of government promulgates state regulations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">executive branch</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Most cases are litigated in state courts and involve claims and defenses under state laws.

Due to the perennial inability of legislatures in the U.S. to enact statutes that would actually force law enforcement officers to respect the constitutional rights of criminal suspects and convicts, the federal judiciary gradually developed the exclusionary rule as a method to enforce such rights. In turn, the exclusionary rule spawned a family of judge-made remedies for the abuse of law enforcement powers, of which the most famous is the Miranda warning. The writ of habeas corpus is often used by suspects and convicts to challenge their detention, while the Civil Rights Act of 1871 and Bivens actions are used by suspects to recover tort damages for police brutality.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What makes up the law of criminal procedure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">federal constitutional case law interwoven with the federal and state statutes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the exclusionary rule provide for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">inability of legislatures in the U.S. to enact statutes that would actually force law enforcement officers to respect the constitutional rights</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What might a suspect use to challenge their detention?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">writ of habeas corpus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What must a police officer recite to a suspect upon arrest/</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Miranda warning</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What acts cover tort damages from police brutality cases?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Civil Rights Act of 1871 and Bivens actions</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The law of civil procedure governs process in all judicial proceedings involving lawsuits between private parties.
