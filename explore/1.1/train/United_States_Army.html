The army was initially led by men who had served in the British Army or colonial militias and who brought much of British military heritage with them. As the Revolutionary War progressed, French aid, resources, and military thinking influenced the new army. A number of European soldiers came on their own to help, such as Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, who taught the army Prussian tactics and organizational skills.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Continental Army created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">14 June 1775</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the commander of the Continental Army?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">George Washington</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what country did Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben come from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Europe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben teach the Continental Army?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prussian tactics and organizational skills</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Vietnam War is often regarded as a low point for the U.S. Army due to the use of drafted personnel, the unpopularity of the war with the American public, and frustrating restrictions placed on the military by American political leaders.

In 1986, the Goldwater–Nichols Act mandated that operational control of the services follows a chain of command from the President to the Secretary of Defense directly to the unified combatant commanders, who have control of all armed forces units in their geographic or function area of responsibility. Thus, the secretaries of the military departments (and their respective service chiefs underneath them) only have the responsibility to organize, train and equip their service components.

As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (1775–83)—before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army.

After the taking control of Lake Erie in 1813, the Americans were able to seize parts of western Upper Canada, burn York and defeat Tecumseh, which caused his Indian Confederacy to collapse. Following ending victories in the province of Upper Canada, which dubbed the U.S. Army &quot;Regulars, by God!&quot;, British troops were able to capture and burn Washington. The regular army, however, proved they were professional and capable of defeating the British army during the invasions of Plattsburgh and Baltimore, prompting British agreement on the previously rejected terms of a status quo ante bellum. Two weeks after a treaty was signed (but not ratified), Andrew Jackson defeated the British in the Battle of New Orleans and became a national hero.

However, because of continuing conflict with Native Americans, it was soon realized that it was necessary to field a trained standing army. The Regular Army was at first very small, and after General St. Clair's defeat at the Battle of the Wabash, the Regular Army was reorganized as the Legion of the United States, which was established in 1791 and renamed the &quot;United States Army&quot; in 1796.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What political party did not have trust in standing armies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">republican</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was defeated at the Battle of the Wabash?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">General St. Clair</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the state militias have ongoing conflict with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Native Americans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Legion of the United States established?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1791</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Legion of the United States renamed to the United States Army?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1796</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Collective training at the unit level takes place at the unit's assigned station, but the most intensive training at higher echelons is conducted at the three combat training centers (CTC); the National Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin, California, the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Polk, Louisiana, and the Joint Multinational Training Center (JMRC) at the Hohenfels Training Area in Hohenfels, Germany.

Its eastern armies fought well, but the western armies were defeated one after another until the Union forces captured New Orleans in 1862 along with the Tennessee River. In the famous Vicksburg Campaign of 1862–63, Ulysses Grant seized the Mississippi River and cut off the Southwest. Grant took command of Union forces in 1864 and after a series of battles with very heavy casualties, he had Lee under siege in Richmond as William T.

Some individuals MOSs range anywhere from 14–20 weeks of One Station Unit Training (OSUT), which combines Basic Training and AIT. The length of AIT school varies by the MOS The length of time spent in AIT depends on the MOS of the soldier, and some highly technical MOS training may require many months (e.g., foreign language translators).

The loss of the divisions did not set well with the states. Their objections included the inadequate maneuver element mix for those that remained and the end to the practice of rotating divisional commands among the states that supported them. Under the proposal, the remaining division commanders were to reside in the state of the division base. No reduction, however, in total Army National Guard strength was to take place, which convinced the governors to accept the plan. The states reorganized their forces accordingly between 1 December 1967 and 1 May 1968.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Secretary of Defense in 1967?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Robert McNamara</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many divisions did the Secretary of Defense cut the original 15 down to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">8</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many brigades did the Secretary of Defense increase the number to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">18</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On September 11, 2001, 53 Army civilians (47 employees and six contractors) and 22 soldiers were among the 125 victims killed in the Pentagon in a terrorist attack when American Airlines Flight 77 commandeered by five Al-Qaeda hijackers slammed into the western side of the building, as part of the September 11 attacks.

Division lineage will be retained, but the divisional headquarters will be able to command any brigade, not just brigades that carry their divisional lineage. The central part of this plan is that each brigade will be modular, i.e., all brigades of the same type will be exactly the same, and thus any brigade can be commanded by any division. As specified before the 2013 end-strength re-definitions, the three major types of ground combat brigades are:</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the army replacing divisions with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">brigades</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How will the brigades be structured?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">modular</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who can command any brigade?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">divisional headquarters</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The army employs various individual weapons to provide light firepower at short ranges.
