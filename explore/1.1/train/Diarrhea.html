It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss. Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour. This can progress to decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe. Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are breastfed, however, may be normal.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is diarrhea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the condition of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one of the effects of diarrhea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">can result in dehydration due to fluid loss</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the warning signs of dehydration?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are other signs of dehydration?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus, bacteria, or parasite; a condition known as gastroenteritis.

Oral rehydration solution (ORS), which is clean water with modest amounts of salts and sugar, is the treatment of choice. Zinc tablets are also recommended. These treatments have been estimated to have saved 50 million children in the past 25 years. When people have diarrhea it is recommended that they continue to eat healthy food and babies continue to be breastfed. If commercial ORS are not available, homemade solutions may be used. In those with severe dehydration, intravenous fluids may be required. Most cases; however, can be managed well with fluids by mouth. Antibiotics, while rarely used, may be recommended in a few cases such as those who have bloody diarrhea and a high fever, those with severe diarrhea following travelling, and those who grow specific bacteria or parasites in their stool. Loperamide may help decrease the number of bowel movement but is not recommended in those with severe disease.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some ways to prevent diarrhea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">improved sanitation, clean drinking water, and hand washing with soap</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What else can a mom do to prevent diarrhea for her baby?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Breastfeeding for at least six months</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the treatment of choice for diarrhea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oral rehydration solution (ORS), which is clean water with modest amounts of salts and sugar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What conditions would a doctor prescribe antibiotics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cases such as those who have bloody diarrhea and a high fever, those with severe diarrhea following travelling, and those who grow specific bacteria or parasites</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>About 1.7 to 5 billion cases of diarrhea occur per year.

If a person drinks solutions with excessive sugar or excessive salt, these can draw water from the body into the bowel and cause osmotic diarrhea. Osmotic diarrhea can also be the result of maldigestion (e.g., pancreatic disease or Coeliac disease), in which the nutrients are left in the lumen to pull in water. Or it can be caused by osmotic laxatives (which work to alleviate constipation by drawing water into the bowels). In healthy individuals, too much magnesium or vitamin C or undigested lactose can produce osmotic diarrhea and distention of the bowel. A person who has lactose intolerance can have difficulty absorbing lactose after an extraordinarily high intake of dairy products. In persons who have fructose malabsorption, excess fructose intake can also cause diarrhea. High-fructose foods that also have a high glucose content are more absorbable and less likely to cause diarrhea. Sugar alcohols such as sorbitol (often found in sugar-free foods) are difficult for the body to absorb and, in large amounts, may lead to osmotic diarrhea. In most of these cases, osmotic diarrhea stops when offending agent (e.g. milk, sorbitol) is stopped.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What occures with osmotic diarrhea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">s when too much water is drawn into the bowels</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What causes osmotic diarrhea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">If a person drinks solutions with excessive sugar or excessive salt, these can draw water from the body into the bowel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do osmotic lazatives work?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">alleviate constipation by drawing water into the bowels</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can cause osmotic diarrhea in healthy people?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">too much magnesium or vitamin C or undigested lactose</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Inflammatory diarrhea occurs when there is damage to the mucosal lining or brush border, which leads to a passive loss of protein-rich fluids and a decreased ability to absorb these lost fluids.

Indeed, this relationship between zinc deficiency reduced immune functioning corresponds with an increased severity of infectious diarrhea. Children who have lowered levels of zinc have a greater number of instances of diarrhea, severe diarrhea, and diarrhea associated with fever. Similarly, vitamin A deficiency can cause an increase in the severity of diarrheal episodes, however there is some discrepancy when it comes to the impact of vitamin A deficiency on the rate of disease. While some argue that a relationship does not exist between the rate of disease and vitamin A status, others suggest an increase in the rate associated with deficiency.

Development of a supplementation strategy should take into consideration the fact that vitamin A supplementation was less effective in reducing diarrhea incidence when compared to vitamin A and zinc supplementation, and that the latter strategy was estimated to be significantly more cost effective.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can be done to combate dietary deficiences?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">promoting better eating practices</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has been used and shown successful in a decrease in incidence of diarrheal disease?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zinc</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">WHat strategy was found out to be more cost effective?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">zinc supplementation</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In many cases of diarrhea, replacing lost fluid and salts is the only treatment needed. This is usually by mouth – oral rehydration therapy – or, in severe cases, intravenously. Diet restrictions such as the BRAT diet are no longer recommended. Research does not support the limiting of milk to children as doing so has no effect on duration of diarrhea. To the contrary, WHO recommends that children with diarrhea continue to eat as sufficient nutrients are usually still absorbed to support continued growth and weight gain, and that continuing to eat also speeds up recovery of normal intestinal functioning. CDC recommends that children and adults with cholera also continue to eat.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the basic treatment many cases of diarrhea need?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">replacing lost fluid and salts is the only treatment needed</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is this treatment given?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">This is usually by mouth – oral rehydration therapy – or, in severe cases, intravenously</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of diet is no longer recommended?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">BRAT diet</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does WHO recommend to do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">children with diarrhea continue to eat as sufficient nutrients are usually still absorbed to support continued growth and weight gain</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Oral rehydration solution (ORS) (a slightly sweetened and salty water) can be used to prevent dehydration. Standard home solutions such as salted rice water, salted yogurt drinks, vegetable and chicken soups with salt can be given. Home solutions such as water in which cereal has been cooked, unsalted soup, green coconut water, weak tea (unsweetened), and unsweetened fresh fruit juices can have from half a teaspoon to full teaspoon of salt (from one-and-a-half to three grams) added per liter. Clean plain water can also be one of several fluids given. There are commercial solutions such as Pedialyte, and relief agencies such as UNICEF widely distribute packets of salts and sugar. A WHO publication for physicians recommends a homemade ORS consisting of one liter water with one teaspoon salt (3 grams) and two tablespoons sugar (18 grams) added (approximately the &quot;taste of tears&quot;). Rehydration Project recommends adding the same amount of sugar but only one-half a teaspoon of salt, stating that this more dilute approach is less risky with very little loss of effectiveness. Both agree that drinks with too much sugar or salt can make dehydration worse.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can be used to prevent dehydration?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oral rehydration solution (ORS)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some good standard home solutions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">salted rice water, salted yogurt drinks, vegetable and chicken soups with salt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a commercial solution that can also be used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pedialyte</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the WHO's recipe for ORS?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one liter water with one teaspoon salt (3 grams) and two tablespoons sugar (18 grams) added</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase dehydration.

Plain water may be used if more specific and effective ORT preparations are unavailable or are not palatable. Additionally, a mix of both plain water and drinks perhaps too rich in sugar and salt can alternatively be given to the same person, with the goal of providing a medium amount of sodium overall.
