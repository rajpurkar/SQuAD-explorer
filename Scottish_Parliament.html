<html><body><div><h1>Scottish_Parliament</h1><h2>Following a referendum in 1997, in which the Scottish electorate voted for devolution, the current Parliament was convened by the Scotland Act 1998, which sets out its powers as a devolved legislature. The Act delineates the legislative competence of the Parliament – the areas in which it can make laws – by explicitly specifying powers that are &quot;reserved&quot; to the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Scottish Parliament has the power to legislate in all areas that are not explicitly reserved to Westminster. The British Parliament retains the ability to amend the terms of reference of the Scottish Parliament, and can extend or reduce the areas in which it can make laws. The first meeting of the new Parliament took place on 12 May 1999.</h2><h3>When was the current parliament of Scotland convened?</h3><p>Following a referendum in 1997</p><p>1998</p><p>1998</p><h3>What act set out the Parliament's powers as a devolved legislature?</h3><p>Scotland Act 1998</p><p>Scotland Act 1998</p><p>Scotland Act</p><h3>The legislative competence of the Parliament species what areas?</h3><p>in which it can make laws</p><p>the areas in which it can make laws</p><p>powers that are &quot;reserved&quot; to the Parliament of the United Kingdom</p><h3>To what body are certain powers explicitly specified as being reserved for?</h3><p>Parliament of the United Kingdom</p><p>Parliament of the United Kingdom</p><p>The British Parliament</p><h3>The Scottish Parliament may legislate as it pleases as long as the powers aren't already reserved by where?</h3><p>Westminster</p><p>Westminster</p><p>Westminster</p><h2>For the next three hundred years, Scotland was directly governed by the Parliament of Great Britain and the subsequent Parliament of the United Kingdom, both seated at Westminster, and the lack of a Parliament of Scotland remained an important element in Scottish national identity. Suggestions for a 'devolved' Parliament were made before 1914, but were shelved due to the outbreak of the First World War. A sharp rise in nationalism in Scotland during the late 1960s fuelled demands for some form of home rule or complete independence, and in 1969 prompted the incumbent Labour government of Harold Wilson to set up the Kilbrandon Commission to consider the British constitution. One of the principal objectives of the commission was to examine ways of enabling more self-government for Scotland, within the unitary state of the United Kingdom. Kilbrandon published his report in 1973 recommending the establishment of a directly elected Scottish Assembly to legislate for the majority of domestic Scottish affairs.</h2><h3>What remained an important issue in Scottish national identity for many years?</h3><p>lack of a Parliament of Scotland</p><p>the lack of a Parliament of Scotland</p><p>the lack of a Parliament of Scotland</p><h3>How many hundred of years was Scotland directly governed by the parliament of Great Britain?</h3><p>three hundred</p><p>three hundred years</p><p>three hundred years</p><h3>Why were the initial suggestions for a devolved parliament before 1914 shelved?</h3><p>First World War.</p><p>First World War</p><p>the outbreak of the First World War</p><h3>When was there a sharp rise in nationalism in Scotland?</h3><p>the late 1960s</p><p>late 1960s</p><p>late 1960s</p><h3>What did Kllbrandon's report in 1973 recommend establishing?</h3><p>directly elected Scottish Assembly</p><p>directly elected Scottish Assembly</p><p>a directly elected Scottish Assembly</p><h2>During this time, the discovery of oil in the North Sea and the following &quot;It's Scotland's oil&quot; campaign of the Scottish National Party (SNP) resulted in rising support for Scottish independence, as well as the SNP. The party argued that the revenues from the oil were not benefitting Scotland as much as they should. The combined effect of these events led to Prime Minister Wilson committing his government to some form of devolved legislature in 1974. However, it was not until 1978 that final legislative proposals for a Scottish Assembly were passed by the United Kingdom Parliament.</h2><h3>Which sea was oil discovered in?</h3><p>North</p><p>North Sea</p><p>the North Sea</p><h3>What campaigh did the Scottish National Party (SNP) run?</h3><p>&quot;It's Scotland's oil&quot;</p><p>It's Scotland's oil</p><p>&quot;It's Scotland's oil&quot;</p><h3>When did Prime Minister Wilson commit to some form of devolved legislature?</h3><p>1974</p><p>1974</p><p>1974</p><h3>What did the SNP publicly opine about the oil revenues?</h3><p>not benefitting Scotland as much as they should</p><p>not benefitting Scotland as much as they should</p><p>the revenues from the oil were not benefitting Scotland as much as they should</p><h3>When was the final legislative proposals for a Scottish Assembly passed?</h3><p>1978</p><p>1978</p><p>1978</p><h2>Under the terms of the Scotland Act 1978, an elected assembly would be set up in Edinburgh provided that the majority of the Scottish electorate voted for it in a referendum to be held on 1 March 1979 that represented at least 40% of the total electorate. The 1979 Scottish devolution referendum to establish a devolved Scottish Assembly failed. Although the vote was 51.6% in favour of a Scottish Assembly, this figure did not equal the 40% of the total electorate threshold deemed necessary to pass the measure, as 32.9% of the eligible voting population did not, or had been unable to, vote.</h2><h3>Where was an elected assembly to be set up, under the terms of the Scotland Act of 1978?</h3><p>Edinburgh</p><p>Edinburgh</p><p>Edinburgh</p><h3>How many of the Scottish electorate would need to for it on the referendum?</h3><p>majority</p><p>40%</p><p>at least 40%</p><h3>What percentage of the vote for a Scottish Assembly in favor of it?</h3><p>51.6%</p><p>51.6%</p><p>51.6%</p><h3>How did trying to establish a devolved Scottish Assembly go in 1979?</h3><p>failed</p><p>failed</p><p>failed</p><h3>What percentage of Scotland's voting population failed to actually vote?</h3><p>32.9%</p><p>32.9%</p><p>32.9%</p><h2>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, demand for a Scottish Parliament grew, in part because the government of the United Kingdom was controlled by the Conservative Party, while Scotland itself elected relatively few Conservative MPs. In the aftermath of the 1979 referendum defeat, the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly was initiated as a pressure group, leading to the 1989 Scottish Constitutional Convention with various organisations such as Scottish churches, political parties and representatives of industry taking part. Publishing its blueprint for devolution in 1995, the Convention provided much of the basis for the structure of the Parliament.</h2><h3>In the range between 1980 and 1990, what did demand for grow?</h3><p>a Scottish Parliament</p><p>Scottish Parliament</p><p>Scottish Parliament grew</p><h3>Whose control of the UK's government helped fuel a desire for a Scottish Parliament?</h3><p>the Conservative Party</p><p>Conservative Party</p><p>the Conservative Party</p><h3>When was the Scottish Constitutional Convention held?</h3><p>1989</p><p>1989</p><p>1989</p><h3>What provided much of the basis for the structure of the Parliament in 1995?</h3><p>blueprint</p><p>blueprint</p><p>the Convention</p><h2>Since September 2004, the official home of the Scottish Parliament has been a new Scottish Parliament Building, in the Holyrood area of Edinburgh. The Scottish Parliament building was designed by Spanish architect Enric Miralles in partnership with local Edinburgh Architecture firm RMJM which was led by Design Principal Tony Kettle. Some of the principal features of the complex include leaf-shaped buildings, a grass-roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and gabion walls formed from the stones of previous buildings. Throughout the building there are many repeated motifs, such as shapes based on Raeburn's Skating Minister. Crow-stepped gables and the upturned boat skylights of the Garden Lobby, complete the unique architecture. Queen Elizabeth II opened the new building on 9 October 2004.</h2><h3>Where has the official home of the Scottish Parliament been since 2004?</h3><p>Scottish Parliament Building</p><p>Scottish Parliament Building</p><p>Edinburgh</p><h3>Who designed the Scottish Parliament building?</h3><p>Enric Miralles</p><p>Enric Miralles</p><p>Enric Miralles</p><h3>What nationality is the architect Enric Miralles?</h3><p>Spanish</p><p>Spanish</p><p>Spanish</p><h3>What shape are some of the buildings in the Parliament complex?</h3><p>leaf-shaped</p><p>leaf-shaped</p><p>leaf-shaped buildings</p><h3>Who opened the new Parliament building on October 9, 2004?</h3><p>Queen Elizabeth II</p><p>Queen Elizabeth II</p><p>Queen Elizabeth II</p><h2>Whilst the permanent building at Holyrood was being constructed, the Parliament's temporary home was the General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. Official photographs and television interviews were held in the courtyard adjoining the Assembly Hall, which is part of the School of Divinity of the University of Edinburgh. This building was vacated twice to allow for the meeting of the Church's General Assembly. In May 2000, the Parliament was temporarily relocated to the former Strathclyde Regional Council debating chamber in Glasgow, and to the University of Aberdeen in May 2002.</h2><h3>What was the building vacated twice to allow for?</h3><p>meeting of the Church's General Assembly</p><p>meeting of the Church's General Assembly</p><p>the meeting of the Church's General Assembly</p><h3>Where was Parliament's temporary home whilst the permanent building was being built?</h3><p>General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland</p><p>General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland</p><p>the General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland</p><h3>Where were interviews held while the parliament was in its temporary building?</h3><p>courtyard</p><p>courtyard adjoining the Assembly Hall</p><p>the courtyard</p><h3>In May 2002, where would you go to address the Parliament?</h3><p>University of Aberdeen</p><p>University of Aberdeen</p><p>the University of Aberdeen</p><h3>Where was Parliament temporarily relocated to in May of 2000?</h3><p>former Strathclyde Regional Council debating chamber in Glasgow</p><p>former Strathclyde Regional Council debating chamber</p><p>the former Strathclyde Regional Council debating chamber</p><h2>In addition to the General Assembly Hall, the Parliament also used buildings rented from the City of Edinburgh Council. The former administrative building of Lothian Regional Council on George IV Bridge was used for the MSP's offices. Following the move to Holyrood in 2004 this building was demolished. The former Midlothian County Buildings facing Parliament Square, High Street and George IV Bridge in Edinburgh (originally built as the headquarters of the pre-1975 Midlothian County Council) housed the Parliament's visitors' centre and shop, whilst the main hall was used as the Parliament's principal committee room.</h2><h3>Who did the Parliament rent additional buildings from?</h3><p>City of Edinburgh Council</p><p>City of Edinburgh Council</p><p>the City of Edinburgh Council</p><h3>What  former administrative building was used for the MSP's offices?</h3><p>Lothian Regional Council</p><p>Lothian Regional Council</p><p>Lothian Regional Council on George IV Bridge</p><h3>What happened to the building on George IV Bridge when the Parliament was done with it?</h3><p>demolished</p><p>demolished</p><p>demolished</p><h3>What do the former Midlothian County Buildings face?</h3><p>Parliament Square, High Street and George IV Bridge in Edinburgh</p><p>Parliament Square, High Street and George IV Bridge</p><p>Parliament Square</p><h3>Which hall was used as Parliament's principle committee room?</h3><p>main</p><p>main</p><p>the main hall</p><h2>After each election to the Scottish Parliament, at the beginning of each parliamentary session, Parliament elects one MSP to serve as Presiding Officer, the equivalent of the speaker (currently Tricia Marwick), and two MSPs to serve as deputies (currently Elaine Smith and John Scott). The Presiding Officer and deputies are elected by a secret ballot of the 129 MSPs, which is the only secret ballot conducted in the Scottish Parliament. Principally, the role of the Presiding Officer is to chair chamber proceedings and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body. When chairing meetings of the Parliament, the Presiding Officer and his/her deputies must be politically impartial. During debates, the Presiding Officer (or the deputy) is assisted by the parliamentary clerks, who give advice on how to interpret the standing orders that govern the proceedings of meetings. A vote clerk sits in front of the Presiding Officer and operates the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks.</h2><h3>Who is elected to serve as the Presiding Officer at the beginning of each parliamentary session?</h3><p>one MSP</p><p>MSP</p><p>MSP</p><h3>Who is currently speaker of the Scottish Parliament?</h3><p>Tricia Marwick</p><p>Tricia Marwick</p><p>Tricia Marwick</p><h3>What type of ballot is used to elect the Presiding Officer and deputies of the Parliament?</h3><p>secret</p><p>secret</p><p>a secret ballot</p><h3>How many MSPs are there?</h3><p>129</p><p>129</p><p>129</p><h3>Who is responsible for operating the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks?</h3><p>A vote clerk</p><p>vote clerk</p><p>vote clerk</p><h2>As a member of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, the Presiding Officer is responsible for ensuring that the Parliament functions effectively and has the staff, property and resources it requires to operate. Convening the Parliamentary Bureau, which allocates time and sets the work agenda in the chamber, is another of the roles of the Presiding Officer. Under the Standing Orders of the Parliament the Bureau consists of the Presiding Officer and one representative from each political parties with five or more seats in the Parliament. Amongst the duties of the Bureau are to agree the timetable of business in the chamber, establish the number, remit and membership of parliamentary committees and regulate the passage of legislation (bills) through the Parliament. The Presiding Officer also represents the Scottish Parliament at home and abroad in an official capacity.</h2><h3>Who is responsible for ensuring the Parliament works smoothly?</h3><p>Presiding Officer</p><p>Presiding Officer</p><p>the Presiding Officer</p><h3>Who sets the work agenda and allocates time in the chamber?</h3><p>the Parliamentary Bureau</p><p>Presiding Officer</p><p>the Parliamentary Bureau</p><h3>How many seats must a political party have to be represented on the Parliamentary Bureau?</h3><p>five</p><p>five or more</p><p>five or more seats</p><h3>Who represents the Scottish Parliament at home and abroad in an official capacity?</h3><p>The Presiding Officer</p><p>Presiding Officer</p><p>The Presiding Officer</p><h2>The debating chamber of the Scottish Parliament has seating arranged in a hemicycle, which reflects the desire to encourage consensus amongst elected members. There are 131 seats in the debating chamber. Of the total 131 seats, 129 are occupied by the Parliament's elected MSPs and 2 are seats for the Scottish Law Officers – the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland, who are not elected members of the Parliament but are members of the Scottish Government. As such the Law Officers may attend and speak in the plenary meetings of the Parliament but, as they are not elected MSPs, cannot vote. Members are able to sit anywhere in the debating chamber, but typically sit in their party groupings. The First Minister, Scottish cabinet ministers and Law officers sit in the front row, in the middle section of the chamber. The largest party in the Parliament sits in the middle of the semicircle, with opposing parties on either side. The Presiding Officer, parliamentary clerks and officials sit opposite members at the front of the debating chamber.</h2><h3>What is the seating arrangement of the debating chamber?</h3><p>hemicycle</p><p>hemicycle</p><p>a hemicycle</p><h3>Why is the seating of the debating chamber arranged as it is?</h3><p>encourage consensus amongst elected members</p><p>encourage consensus amongst elected members</p><p>reflects the desire to encourage consensus amongst elected members</p><h3>How many seats are in the debating chamber?</h3><p>131</p><p>131</p><p>131</p><h3>How many members in the seats of the Scottish Parliament are members of the Scottish Government?</h3><p>2</p><p>2</p><p>2</p><h3>What can the non-elected members from the Scottish Government not do?</h3><p>vote</p><p>vote</p><p>vote</p><h2>In front of the Presiding Officers' desk is the parliamentary mace, which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words: Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity. The words There shall be a Scottish Parliament, which are the first words of the Scotland Act, are inscribed around the head of the mace, which has a formal ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament, reinforcing the authority of the Parliament in its ability to make laws. Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon its official opening in July 1999, the mace is displayed in a glass case suspended from the lid. At the beginning of each sitting in the chamber, the lid of the case is rotated so that the mace is above the glass, to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.</h2><h3>Where does the gold in the parliamentary mace come from?</h3><p>Scottish rivers</p><p>Scottish rivers</p><p>Scottish rivers</p><h3>What is the parliamentary mace made of?</h3><p>silver</p><p>silver</p><p>silver and inlaid with gold</p><h3>Who presented the mac to the Scottish Parliament when it was initially opened?</h3><p>the Queen</p><p>the Queen</p><p>the Queen</p><h3>What words are inscribed on the mace of parliament?</h3><p>Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity</p><p>Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity</p><p>Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity</p><h3>What is the mace displayed in?</h3><p>a glass case suspended from the lid</p><p>glass case</p><p>a glass case</p><h2>Parliament typically sits Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from early January to late June and from early September to mid December, with two-week recesses in April and October. Plenary meetings in the debating chamber usually take place on Wednesday afternoons from 2 pm to 6 pm and on Thursdays from 9:15 am to 6 pm. Chamber debates and committee meetings are open to the public. Entry is free, but booking in advance is recommended due to limited space. Meetings are broadcast on the Parliament's own channel Holyrood.tv and on the BBC's parliamentary channel BBC Parliament. Proceedings are also recorded in text form, in print and online, in the Official Report, which is the substantially verbatim transcript of parliamentary debates.</h2><h3>Which month is the first in the year Parliament takes a two week vacation?</h3><p>April</p><p>April</p><p>April</p><h3>Where do plenary meetings take place?</h3><p>debating chamber</p><p>debating chamber</p><p>Wednesday afternoons</p><h3>Who are debates and meetings open to?</h3><p>the public</p><p>the public.</p><p>public</p><h3>How much does it cost to gain entry to a parliament meeting?</h3><p>free</p><p>free</p><p>free</p><h3>What contains a nearly verbatim of parliamentary debates?</h3><p>the Official Report</p><p>the Official Report</p><p>the Official Report</p><h2>The first item of business on Wednesdays is usually Time for Reflection, at which a speaker addresses members for up to four minutes, sharing a perspective on issues of faith. This contrasts with the formal style of &quot;Prayers&quot;, which is the first item of business in meetings of the House of Commons. Speakers are drawn from across Scotland and are chosen to represent the balance of religious beliefs according to the Scottish census. Invitations to address Parliament in this manner are determined by the Presiding Officer on the advice of the parliamentary bureau.

Normally, the Presiding Officer tries to achieve a balance between different viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak. Typically, ministers or party leaders open debates, with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes, and succeeding speakers allocated less time. The Presiding Officer can reduce speaking time if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate. Debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems. Members may call each other directly by name, rather than by constituency or cabinet position, and hand clapping is allowed. Speeches to the chamber are normally delivered in English, but members may use Scots, Gaelic, or any other language with the agreement of the Presiding Officer. The Scottish Parliament has conducted debates in the Gaelic language.</h2><h3>Who decides who gets to speak in the chamber debates?</h3><p>The Presiding Officer</p><p>Presiding Officer</p><p>The Presiding Officer</p><h3>What is also decided by the Presiding Officer?</h3><p>amount of time for which they are allowed to speak</p><p>amount of time for which they are allowed to speak</p><p>the amount of time for which they are allowed to speak</p><h3>What does the Presiding Officer try to achieve a balance of between speakers?</h3><p>different viewpoints</p><p>different viewpoints and political parties</p><p>a balance between different viewpoints and political parties</p><h3>What members typically open debates?</h3><p>ministers or party leaders</p><p>ministers or party leaders</p><p>ministers or party leaders</p><h3>What language other than English has the Scottish Parliament had meetings in?</h3><p>Gaelic</p><p>Gaelic</p><p>Scots, Gaelic, or any other language with the agreement of the Presiding Officer</p><h2>Each sitting day, normally at 5 pm, MSPs decide on all the motions and amendments that have been moved that day. This &quot;Decision Time&quot; is heralded by the sounding of the division bell, which is heard throughout the Parliamentary campus and alerts MSPs who are not in the chamber to return and vote. At Decision Time, the Presiding Officer puts questions on the motions and amendments by reading out the name of the motion or amendment as well as the proposer and asking &quot;Are we all agreed?&quot;, to which the chamber first votes orally. If there is audible dissent, the Presiding Officer announces &quot;There will be a division&quot; and members vote by means of electronic consoles on their desks. Each MSP has a unique access card with a microchip which, when inserted into the console, identifies them and allows them to vote. As a result, the outcome of each division is known in seconds.</h2><h3>What time do the MSPs normally decide on the motions and amendments from that day?</h3><p>5 pm</p><p>5 pm</p><p>5 pm</p><h3>What is heralded by the sounding of the division bell?</h3><p>&quot;Decision Time&quot;</p><p>Decision Time</p><p>&quot;Decision Time&quot;</p><h3>What do MSPs who are not in the chamber when the division bell rings return to do?</h3><p>vote</p><p>vote</p><p>vote</p><h3>How do members vote when there is a division?</h3><p>electronic consoles on their desks</p><p>electronic consoles</p><p>electronic consoles on their desks</p><h3>How long does it take to know the outcome of a division?</h3><p>seconds</p><p>seconds</p><p>seconds</p><h2>The outcome of most votes can be predicted beforehand since political parties normally instruct members which way to vote. Parties entrust some MSPs, known as whips, with the task of ensuring that party members vote according to the party line. MSPs do not tend to vote against such instructions, since those who do are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties. Errant members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections, and, in serious cases, may be expelled from their parties outright. Thus, as with many Parliaments, the independence of Members of the Scottish Parliament tends to be low, and backbench rebellions by members who are discontent with their party's policies are rare. In some circumstances, however, parties announce &quot;free votes&quot;, which allows Members to vote as they please. This is typically done on moral issues.</h2><h3>What can often be predicted beforehand?</h3><p>votes</p><p>outcome of most votes</p><p>outcome</p><h3>Who normally instructs members how to vote?</h3><p>political parties</p><p>political parties</p><p>political parties</p><h3>Who has the task of ensuring party members vote according to the party line?</h3><p>whips</p><p>whips</p><p>whips</p><h3>What type of issues are members typically allowed to vote as they please?</h3><p>moral</p><p>moral</p><p>moral issues</p><h3>What happens if a member doesn't vote the party line?</h3><p>deselected as official party candidates during future elections</p><p>deselected as official party candidates</p><p>deselected as official party candidates during future elections</p><h2>Immediately after Decision Time a &quot;Members Debate&quot; is held, which lasts for 45 minutes. Members Business is a debate on a motion proposed by an MSP who is not a Scottish minister. Such motions are on issues which may be of interest to a particular area such as a member's own constituency, an upcoming or past event or any other item which would otherwise not be accorded official parliamentary time. As well as the proposer, other members normally contribute to the debate. The relevant minister, whose department the debate and motion relate to &quot;winds up&quot; the debate by speaking after all other participants.</h2><h3>When is the Members Debate held?</h3><p>Immediately after Decision Time</p><p>Immediately after Decision Time</p><p>Immediately after Decision Time</p><h3>Why are debates on proposed motions by an MSP conducted?</h3><p>not a Scottish minister</p><p>may be of interest to a particular area such as a member's own constituency</p><p>issues which may be of interest to a particular area such as a member's own constituency</p><h3>How long does the Members Debate last?</h3><p>45 minutes</p><p>45 minutes</p><p>45 minutes</p><h3>Who contributes to Members Business in addition to the proposer?</h3><p>other members</p><p>other members</p><p>other members</p><h3>What does the minister who was the catalyst of the Members Business do by speaking after everyone else?</h3><p>winds up</p><p>winds up</p><p>&quot;winds up&quot; the debate</p><h2>Much of the work of the Scottish Parliament is done in committee. The role of committees is stronger in the Scottish Parliament than in other parliamentary systems, partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for the fact that there is no revising chamber. The principal role of committees in the Scottish Parliament is to take evidence from witnesses, conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation. Committee meetings take place on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning when Parliament is sitting. Committees can also meet at other locations throughout Scotland.</h2><h3>Where is much of the work of the Scottish Parliament done?</h3><p>committee</p><p>committee</p><p>in committee</p><h3>What are committees in the Scottish Parliament compared to other systems?</h3><p>stronger</p><p>stronger</p><p>stronger in the Scottish Parliament than in other parliamentary systems</p><h3>What is one avenue being compensated for by having committees serve such a large role?</h3><p>no revising chamber</p><p>no revising chamber</p><p>take evidence from witnesses, conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation</p><h3>Taking evidence from witnesses is one of committees' what?</h3><p>principal role</p><p>principal role</p><p>principal role</p><h3>Where might committees meet outside of Parliament?</h3><p>other locations throughout Scotland</p><p>other locations throughout Scotland</p><p>other locations throughout Scotland</p><h2>Committees comprise a small number of MSPs, with membership reflecting the balance of parties across Parliament.

Private bills normally relate to large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property. Private Bill Committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the Edinburgh Tram Network, the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link and extensions to the National Gallery of Scotland.</h2><h3>What is set up to scrutinize private bills submitted by party outsiders?</h3><p>type of committee</p><p>committee</p><p>committee</p><h3>What topic do private bills typically have?</h3><p>large-scale development projects</p><p>large-scale development projects</p><p>large-scale development projects</p><h3>Who decides how land or property is allowed to be used?</h3><p>Scottish Government.</p><p>Committees</p><p>Private Bill Committees</p><h3>What kind of committee considered legislation on the development of the Edinburgh Tram Network?</h3><p>Private Bill</p><p>Private Bill</p><p>Private Bill Committees</p><h2>The Scotland Act 1998, which was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and given royal assent by Queen Elizabeth II on 19 November 1998, governs the functions and role of the Scottish Parliament and delimits its legislative competence. The Scotland Act 2012 extends the devolved competencies. For the purposes of parliamentary sovereignty, the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster continues to constitute the supreme legislature of Scotland. However, under the terms of the Scotland Act, Westminster agreed to devolve some of its responsibilities over Scottish domestic policy to the Scottish Parliament. Such &quot;devolved matters&quot; include education, health, agriculture and justice. The Scotland Act enabled the Scottish Parliament to pass primary legislation on these issues. A degree of domestic authority, and all foreign policy, remain with the UK Parliament in Westminster. The Scottish Parliament has the power to pass laws and has limited tax-varying capability. Another of the roles of the Parliament is to hold the Scottish Government to account.</h2><h3>What act sets forth the functions of the Scottish Parliament?</h3><p>Scotland Act 1998</p><p>The Scotland Act 1998</p><p>The Scotland Act 1998</p><h3>Who gave her royal assent to the Scotland Act of 1998?</h3><p>Queen Elizabeth II</p><p>Queen Elizabeth II</p><p>Queen Elizabeth II</p><h3>What does the Scotland Act of 2012 extend?</h3><p>devolved competencies</p><p>devolved competencies</p><p>the devolved competencies</p><h3>What body constitutes the supreme legislature of Scotland?</h3><p>Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster</p><p>Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster</p><p>the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster</p><h3>Who has the role of holding the Scottish Government to account?</h3><p>Scottish Parliament</p><p>Parliament</p><p>the Parliament</p><h2>The specific devolved matters are all subjects which are not explicitly stated in Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act as reserved matters. All matters that are not specifically reserved are automatically devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Most importantly, this includes agriculture, fisheries and forestry, economic development, education, environment, food standards, health, home affairs, Scots law – courts, police and fire services, local government, sport and the arts, transport, training, tourism, research and statistics and social work. The Scottish Parliament has the ability to alter income tax in Scotland by up to 3 pence in the pound. The 2012 Act conferred further fiscal devolution including borrowing powers and some other unconnected matters such as setting speed limits and control of air guns.</h2><h3>Where are reserved matters stated in the Scotland Act?</h3><p>Schedule 5</p><p>Schedule 5</p><p>Schedule 5</p><h3>If a matter is not specifically reserved, who is it devolved to?</h3><p>Scottish Parliament</p><p>Scottish Parliament</p><p>the Scottish Parliament</p><h3>Why do police and fire services fall under the purview of the Scottish Parliament?</h3><p>automatically devolved</p><p>not specifically reserved</p><p>All matters that are not specifically reserved are automatically devolved to the Scottish Parliament</p><h3>How much can the SP alter income tax in Scotland?</h3><p>up to 3 pence in the pound</p><p>up to 3 pence in the pound</p><p>up to 3 pence in the pound</p><h3>Setting speed limits was one of the further devolutions which was conferred by what act?</h3><p>2012 Act</p><p>2012 Act</p><p>The 2012 Act</p><h2>Reserved matters are subjects that are outside the legislative competence of the Scotland Parliament. The Scottish Parliament is unable to legislate on such issues that are reserved to, and dealt with at, Westminster (and where Ministerial functions usually lie with UK Government ministers). These include abortion, broadcasting policy, civil service, common markets for UK goods and services, constitution, electricity, coal, oil, gas, nuclear energy, defence and national security, drug policy, employment, foreign policy and relations with Europe, most aspects of transport safety and regulation, National Lottery, protection of borders, social security and stability of UK's fiscal, economic and monetary system.</h2><h3>What is the name of matters outside the legislative ability of the Scottish Parliament?</h3><p>Reserved</p><p>Reserved</p><p>Reserved matters</p><h3>Issues dealt with at Westminster are not ones who is able to deal with?</h3><p>Scottish Parliament</p><p>The Scottish Parliament</p><p>The Scottish Parliament</p><h3>Where are issues like abortion and drug policy legislated on?</h3><p>Westminster</p><p>Westminster</p><p>Westminster</p><h3>Most aspects of transport safety is a subject dealt with by whom?</h3><p>UK Government ministers</p><p>UK Government ministers</p><p>Westminster</p><h2>Bills can be introduced to Parliament in a number of ways; the Scottish Government can introduce new laws or amendments to existing laws as a bill; a committee of the Parliament can present a bill in one of the areas under its remit; a member of the Scottish Parliament can introduce a bill as a private member; or a private bill can be submitted to Parliament by an outside proposer. Most draft laws are government bills introduced by ministers in the governing party. Bills pass through Parliament in a number of stages:</h2><h3>What may be presented to Parliament in various ways?</h3><p>Bills</p><p>Bills</p><p>Bills</p><h3>Who may introduce new laws or amendments to laws already on the books as a bill?</h3><p>the Scottish Government</p><p>Scottish Government</p><p>the Scottish Government</p><h3>An MSP may introduce a bill as what?</h3><p>a private member</p><p>a private member</p><p>private member</p><h3>Who may also submit private bills to Parliament?</h3><p>an outside proposer</p><p>an outside proposer</p><p>an outside proposer</p><h3>How do bills pass through Parliament?</h3><p>in a number of stages</p><p>a number of stages</p><p>in a number of stages</p><h2>Stage 1 is the first, or introductory stage of the bill, where the minister or member in charge of the bill will formally introduce it to Parliament together with its accompanying documents – Explanatory Notes, a Policy Memorandum setting out the policy underlying the bill, and a Financial Memorandum setting out the costs and savings associated with it. Statements from the Presiding Officer and the member in charge of the bill are also lodged indicating whether the bill is within the legislative competence of the Parliament. Stage 1 usually takes place, initially, in the relevant committee or committees and is then submitted to the whole Parliament for a full debate in the chamber on the general principles of the bill. If the whole Parliament agrees in a vote to the general principles of the bill, it then proceeds to Stage 2.</h2><h3>What is stage 1 in the life of a bill?</h3><p>introductory</p><p>introductory</p><p>introductory stage of the bill</p><h3>What are presented to parliament in addition to the bill itself?</h3><p>accompanying documents</p><p>accompanying documents</p><p>accompanying documents – Explanatory Notes</p><h3>What do statements from the PO and member in charge of the bill also indicate?</h3><p>whether the bill is within the legislative competence of the Parliament</p><p>whether the bill is within the legislative competence of the Parliament</p><p>whether the bill is within the legislative competence of the Parliament</p><h3>Where are bills typically gestated in Stage 1?</h3><p>in the relevant committee or committees</p><p>committee</p><p>the whole Parliament</p><h3>If Parliament agrees in a vote to the general principle of a bill, what does it then proceed to?</h3><p>Stage 2</p><p>Stage 2</p><p>Stage 2</p><h2>Stage 3 is the final stage of the bill and is considered at a meeting of the whole Parliament. This stage comprises two parts: consideration of amendments to the bill as a general debate, and a final vote on the bill. Opposition members can table &quot;wrecking amendments&quot; to the bill, designed to thwart further progress and take up parliamentary time, to cause the bill to fall without a final vote being taken. After a general debate on the final form of the bill, members proceed to vote at Decision Time on whether they agree to the general principles of the final bill.</h2><h3>What is the final stage of a bill in the Scottish Parliament?</h3><p>Stage 3</p><p>Stage 3</p><p>Stage 3</p><h3>How many parts does the consideration of a bill in Stage 3 have?</h3><p>two</p><p>two</p><p>two</p><h3>What vote on a bill takes place in Stage 3?</h3><p>final</p><p>final</p><p>final vote</p><h3>What type of amendments might members opposed to a bill put on the table?</h3><p>wrecking</p><p>wrecking</p><p>&quot;wrecking amendments&quot;</p><h3>When do members proceed to vote on whether they agree to the principles of the final bill?</h3><p>Decision Time</p><p>Decision Time</p><p>After a general debate on the final form of the bill</p><h2>Royal assent: After the bill has been passed, the Presiding Officer submits it to the Monarch for royal assent and it becomes an Act of the Scottish Parliament. However he cannot do so until a 4-week period has elapsed, during which the Law Officers of the Scottish Government or UK Government can refer the bill to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom for a ruling on whether it is within the powers of the Parliament. Acts of the Scottish Parliament do not begin with a conventional enacting formula. Instead they begin with a phrase that reads: &quot;The Bill for this Act of the Scottish Parliament was passed by the Parliament on [Date] and received royal assent on [Date]&quot;.</h2><h3>Who does the Presiding Officer submit the final bill to?</h3><p>the Monarch</p><p>Monarch</p><p>the Monarch</p><h3>Why is the final bill passed to the Monarch?</h3><p>royal assent</p><p>royal assent</p><p>royal assent</p><h3>What is the minimum amount of time before a bill can go into law?</h3><p>a 4-week period</p><p>a 4-week period</p><p>4-week period</p><h3>Who is a bill referred to for a ruling on whether it's within the powers of the Parliament?</h3><p>Supreme Court of the United Kingdom</p><p>Supreme Court of the United Kingdom</p><p>the Supreme Court</p><h3>What does the template for bills passed by the Scottish Parliament include?</h3><p>[Date]</p><p>[Date]</p><p>&quot;The Bill for this Act of the Scottish Parliament was passed by the Parliament on [Date] and received royal assent on [Date]&quot;.</p><h2>The party, or parties, that hold the majority of seats in the Parliament forms the Scottish Government. In contrast to many other parliamentary systems, Parliament elects a First Minister from a number of candidates at the beginning of each parliamentary term (after a general election). Any member can put their name forward to be First Minister, and a vote is taken by all members of Parliament. Normally, the leader of the largest party is returned as First Minister, and head of the Scottish Government. Theoretically, Parliament also elects the Scottish Ministers who form the government of Scotland and sit in the Scottish cabinet, but such ministers are, in practice, appointed to their roles by the First Minister. Junior ministers, who do not attend cabinet, are also appointed to assist Scottish ministers in their departments. Most ministers and their juniors are drawn from amongst the elected MSPs, with the exception of Scotland's Chief Law Officers: the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General. Whilst the First Minister chooses the ministers – and may decide to remove them at any time – the formal appointment or dismissal is made by the Sovereign.</h2><h3>What party forms the Scottish Parliament?</h3><p>hold the majority of seats</p><p>hold the majority of seats</p><p>The party, or parties, that hold the majority of seats in the Parliament</p><h3>Who is eligible to toss their name in the hat to be First Minister?</h3><p>Any member</p><p>Any member</p><p>Any member</p><h3>Who is elected at the beginning of each term?</h3><p>First Minister</p><p>First Minister</p><p>a First Minister</p><h3>Other than Scotland's Chief Law Officer, from whence are most ministers drawn from amongst?</h3><p>elected MSPs</p><p>the elected MSPs</p><p>amongst the elected MSPs</p><h3>Who makes formal appointment or dismissal decisions?</h3><p>the Sovereign</p><p>the Sovereign</p><p>the Sovereign</p><h2>Under the Scotland Act 1998, ordinary general elections for the Scottish Parliament are held on the first Thursday in May every four years (1999, 2003, 2007 and so on). The date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way by the Monarch on the proposal of the Presiding Officer. If the Parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved (with at least two-thirds of the Members voting in favour), or if the Parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be First Minister within 28 days of a General Election or of the position becoming vacant, the Presiding Officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the Parliament is dissolved by the Queen by royal proclamation. Extraordinary general elections are in addition to ordinary general elections, unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it. The following ordinary election reverts to the first Thursday in May, a multiple of four years after 1999 (i.e., 5 May 2011, 7 May 2015, etc.).</h2><h3>What day of the week are general elections held?</h3><p>Thursday</p><p>Thursday</p><p>Thursday</p><h3>What month, every four years, are the ordinary general elections held on?</h3><p>May</p><p>May</p><p>May</p><h3>Who may change the date by up to a month, on the proposal of the PO?</h3><p>the Monarch</p><p>Monarch</p><p>the Monarch</p><h3>If an extraordinary election is held within less than six months before the date of an ordinary election, what does it do to the ordinary election?</h3><p>supplant it.</p><p>supplant it</p><p>reverts to the first Thursday in May, a multiple of four years after 1999</p><h3>How many days does the Parliament have to nominate a First Minister after a General Election?</h3><p>28</p><p>28</p><p>28 days</p><h2>Several procedures enable the Scottish Parliament to scrutinise the Government. The First Minister or members of the cabinet can deliver statements to Parliament upon which MSPs are invited to question. For example, at the beginning of each parliamentary year, the First Minister delivers a statement to the chamber setting out the Government's legislative programme for the forthcoming year. After the statement has been delivered, the leaders of the opposition parties and other MSPs question the First Minister on issues related to the substance of the statement.</h2><h3>What enables the Scottish Parliament to scrutinize the government?</h3><p>Several procedures</p><p>Several procedures</p><p>Several procedures</p><h3>Who can question statements the First Minister or members of the cabinet make?</h3><p>MSPs</p><p>leaders of the opposition parties and other MSPs</p><p>MSPs</p><h3>What does the First Minister deliver at the beginning of each parliamentary year?</h3><p>legislative programme for the forthcoming year</p><p>a statement</p><p>a statement to the chamber setting out the Government's legislative programme for the forthcoming year</p><h3>What do the leaders of the opposition parties and other MSPs question the First Minister about?</h3><p>issues related to the substance of the statement</p><p>issues</p><p>issues related to the substance of the statement</p><h2>Parliamentary time is also set aside for question periods in the debating chamber. A &quot;General Question Time&quot; takes place on a Thursday between 11:40 a.m. and 12 p.m. where members can direct questions to any member of the Scottish Government. At 2.30pm, a 40-minute long themed &quot;Question Time&quot; takes place, where members can ask questions of ministers in departments that are selected for questioning that sitting day, such as health and justice or education and transport. Between 12 p.m. and 12:30 p.m. on Thursdays, when Parliament is sitting, First Minister's Question Time takes place. This gives members an opportunity to question the First Minister directly on issues under their jurisdiction. Opposition leaders ask a general question of the First Minister and then supplementary questions. Such a practice enables a &quot;lead-in&quot; to the questioner, who then uses their supplementary question to ask the First Minister any issue. The four general questions available to opposition leaders are:</h2><h3>What is set aside for question periods in the debating chamber?</h3><p>Parliamentary time</p><p>Parliamentary time</p><p>Parliamentary time</p><h3>On what day does a General Question Time take place?</h3><p>Thursday</p><p>Thursday</p><p>Thursday</p><h3>Who may members direct questions towards during General Question Time?</h3><p>any member of the Scottish Government</p><p>any member of the Scottish Government</p><p>ministers in departments that are selected for questioning that sitting day</p><h3>What may members question the First Minister about directly during First Minister's Question Time?</h3><p>issues under their jurisdiction</p><p>issues under their jurisdiction</p><p>the First Minister</p><h3>How many general questions are available to opposition leaders?</h3><p>four</p><p>four</p><p>four</p><h2>Of the 129 MSPs, 73 are elected to represent first past the post constituencies and are known as &quot;Constituency MSPs&quot;. Voters choose one member to represent the constituency, and the member with most votes is returned as a constituency MSP. The 73 Scottish Parliament constituencies shared the same boundaries as the UK Parliament constituencies in Scotland, prior to the 2005 reduction in the number of Scottish MPs, with the exception of Orkney and Shetland which each return their own constituency MSP. Currently, the average Scottish Parliament constituency comprises 55,000 electors. Given the geographical distribution of population in Scotland, this results in constituencies of a smaller area in the Central Lowlands, where the bulk of Scotland's population live, and much larger constituency areas in the north and west of the country, which have a low population density. The island archipelagos of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles comprise a much smaller number of electors, due to their dispersed population and distance from the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh. If a Constituency MSP resigns from Parliament, this triggers a by-election in his or her constituency, where a replacement MSP is returned from one of the parties by the plurality system.</h2><h3>What is the number of Constituency MSPs?</h3><p>73</p><p>73</p><p>73</p><h3>When was there a reduction in the number of Scottish MPs?</h3><p>2005</p><p>2005</p><p>2005</p><h3>How many members can voters choose to represent the constituency? </h3><p>one</p><p>one</p><p>one</p><h3>Why do the island archipelagos comprise a smaller number of electors?</h3><p>dispersed population and distance</p><p>dispersed population and distance</p><p>their dispersed population and distance from the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh</p><h3>What is the current number of electors currently in a Scottish Parliament constituency? </h3><p>55,000</p><p>55,000</p><p>55,000</p><h2>The total number of seats in the Parliament are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'Hondt method. For example, to determine who is awarded the first list seat, the number of list votes cast for each party is divided by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region (at this point just constituency seats). The party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat, which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat. This is repeated iteratively until all available list seats are allocated.</h2><h3>How are the total numbers of seats allocated to parties?</h3><p>proportionally to the number of votes received</p><p>proportionally to the number of votes received</p><p>proportionally to the number of votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'Hondt method</p><h3>What method is used for tallying votes in the second vote of the ballot?</h3><p>the d'Hondt method</p><p>d'Hondt</p><p>the d'Hondt method</p><h3>The party awarded a seat is the one with the highest what?</h3><p>quotient</p><p>quotient</p><p>quotient</p><h3>What set is a seat added to after being allocated?</h3><p>constituency seats</p><p>constituency</p><p>second</p><h3>How is the process of allocating seats repeated until all available seats have been determined?</h3><p>iteratively</p><p>iteratively</p><p>iteratively</p><h2>As in the House of Commons, a number of qualifications apply to being an MSP. Such qualifications were introduced under the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 and the British Nationality Act 1981. Specifically, members must be over the age of 18 and must be a citizen of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, one of the countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, a citizen of a British overseas territory, or a European Union citizen resident in the UK. Members of the police and the armed forces are disqualified from sitting in the Scottish Parliament as elected MSPs, and similarly, civil servants and members of foreign legislatures are disqualified. An individual may not sit in the Scottish Parliament if he or she is judged to be insane under the terms of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003.</h2><h3>What does being an MSP share with the House of Commons?</h3><p>a number of qualifications</p><p>a number of qualifications</p><p>qualifications</p><h3>When was the British Nationality Act passed?</h3><p>1981</p><p>1981</p><p>1981</p><h3>How old most a person be to apply to be an MSP?</h3><p>over the age of 18</p><p>over the age of 18</p><p>18</p><h3>Members of which organizations are disqualified from sitting in the SP as elected MSPs?</h3><p>police and the armed forces</p><p>police and the armed forces</p><p>the police and the armed forces</p><h3>What act sets the term for judging the boundaries of sanity to which individuals wishing to sit on the SP must adhere?</h3><p>Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003</p><p>Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003</p><p>Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003</p><h2>The election produced a majority SNP government, making this the first time in the Scottish Parliament where a party has commanded a parliamentary majority. The SNP took 16 seats from Labour, with many of their key figures not returned to parliament, although Labour leader Iain Gray retained East Lothian by 151 votes. The SNP took a further eight seats from the Liberal Democrats and one seat from the Conservatives. The SNP overall majority meant that there was sufficient support in the Scottish Parliament to hold a referendum on Scottish independence.</h2><h3>When the election produced an SNP majority government, what was it the first occurrence of?</h3><p>a party has commanded a parliamentary majority</p><p>a parliamentary majority</p><p>a party has commanded a parliamentary majority</p><h3>Who did the SNP obtain 16 seats from?</h3><p>Labour</p><p>Labour</p><p>Labour</p><h3>By how much did Labour lead Lain Gray retain East Lothian?</h3><p>151 votes</p><p>151 votes</p><p>151 votes</p><h3>How many seats did the SNP take from the Liberal Democrats?</h3><p>eight</p><p>eight</p><p>eight</p><h3>What did the result of the SNP majority allow a referendum be held on?</h3><p>Scottish independence</p><p>Scottish independence</p><p>Scottish independence</p><h2>For the Conservatives, the main disappointment was the loss of Edinburgh Pentlands, the seat of former party leader David McLetchie, to the SNP.

This phenomenon is known as the West Lothian question and has led to criticism.
