<html><body><div><h1>Geology</h1><h2>There are three major types of rock: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. The rock cycle is an important concept in geology which illustrates the relationships between these three types of rock, and magma. When a rock crystallizes from melt (magma and/or lava), it is an igneous rock. This rock can be weathered and eroded, and then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock, or be turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure that change the mineral content of the rock which gives it a characteristic fabric. The sedimentary rock can then be subsequently turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure and is then weathered, eroded, deposited, and lithified, ultimately becoming a sedimentary rock. Sedimentary rock may also be re-eroded and redeposited, and metamorphic rock may also undergo additional metamorphism. All three types of rocks may be re-melted; when this happens, a new magma is formed, from which an igneous rock may once again crystallize.</h2><h3>An igneous rock is a rock that crystallizes from what?</h3><p>melt (magma and/or lava)</p><p>melt</p><p>rock crystallizes from melt (magma and/or lava)</p><p>melt (magma and/or lava)</p><h3>Sedimentary rock can be turned into which of the three types of rock?</h3><p>metamorphic rock</p><p>metamorphic</p><p>metamorphic rock</p><p>metamorphic</p><h3>When the three types of rock are re-melted what is formed? </h3><p>new magma</p><p>igneous</p><p>new magma</p><p>magma</p><h3>What are the three major types of rock? </h3><p>igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic</p><p>igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic</p><p>igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic</p><p>igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic</p><h3>What changes the mineral content of a rock?</h3><p>heat and pressure</p><p>heat and pressure</p><p>heat and pressure</p><p>heat and pressure</p><h2>In the 1960s, a series of discoveries, the most important of which was seafloor spreading, showed that the Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle, is separated into a number of tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming, solid, upper mantle, which is called the asthenosphere. There is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of the mantle: oceanic plate motions and mantle convection currents always move in the same direction, because the oceanic lithosphere is the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of the convecting mantle. This coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the Earth and the convecting mantle is called plate tectonics.</h2><h3>What was the most important discovery that led to the understanding that Earth's lithosphere is separated into tectonic plates?</h3><p>seafloor spreading</p><p>seafloor spreading</p><p>seafloor spreading</p><p>seafloor spreading</p><h3>Which parts of the Earth are included in the lithosphere? </h3><p>the crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle</p><p>crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle</p><p>crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle</p><p>crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle</p><h3>What is another word for the Earth's upper mantle?</h3><p>asthenosphere</p><p>asthenosphere</p><p>asthenosphere</p><p>asthenosphere</p><h3>Plate tectonics can be seen as the intimate coupling between rigid plates on the surface of the Earth and what? </h3><p>the convecting mantle</p><p>convection of the mantle</p><p>convection of the mantle</p><p>the convecting mantle</p><h3>In what decade was seafloor spreading discovered? </h3><p>the 1960s</p><p>1960s</p><p>1960s</p><p>1960s</p><h2>The development of plate tectonics provided a physical basis for many observations of the solid Earth. Long linear regions of geologic features could be explained as plate boundaries. Mid-ocean ridges, high regions on the seafloor where hydrothermal vents and volcanoes exist, were explained as divergent boundaries, where two plates move apart. Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes were explained as convergent boundaries, where one plate subducts under another. Transform boundaries, such as the San Andreas fault system, resulted in widespread powerful earthquakes. Plate tectonics also provided a mechanism for Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift, in which the continents move across the surface of the Earth over geologic time. They also provided a driving force for crustal deformation, and a new setting for the observations of structural geology. The power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle.</h2><h3>What is the area called where two plates move apart?</h3><p>divergent boundaries</p><p>divergent boundaries</p><p>divergent boundaries</p><p>divergent boundaries</p><h3>What is the area called where one plate subducts under another?</h3><p>convergent boundaries</p><p>convergent boundaries</p><p>convergent boundaries</p><p>convergent boundaries</p><h3>What type of fault boundary is defined by having widespread powerful earthquakes, as in the state of California?</h3><p>Transform boundaries</p><p>Transform</p><p>Transform boundaries</p><p>Transform boundaries</p><h3>Whose theory was the theory of continental drift?</h3><p>Alfred Wegener</p><p>Alfred Wegener</p><p>Alfred Wegener</p><p>Alfred Wegener</p><h3>The lithosphere moves over which mantle n the theory of plate tectonics?</h3><p>the convecting mantle</p><p>convecting mantle</p><p>convecting</p><p>convecting</p><h2>Seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to image the interior of the Earth. Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core (where shear waves were not able to propagate) and a dense solid inner core. These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth, with a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan. These images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the Earth, and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model.</h2><h3>What types of waves do seismologists use to image the interior of the Earth?</h3><p>seismic waves</p><p>seismic</p><p>seismic</p><p>seismic</p><h3>In the layered model of the Earth, the outermost layer is what? </h3><p>crust</p><p>crust</p><p>lithosphere</p><p>crust and lithosphere</p><h3>In the layered model of the Earth there are seismic discontinuities in which layer? </h3><p>the mantle</p><p>mantle</p><p>mantle</p><p>mantle</p><h3>Recently a more detailed model of the Earth was developed.

The first shows the entire time from the formation of the Earth to the present, but this compresses the most recent eon. Therefore, the second scale shows the most recent eon with an expanded scale. The second scale compresses the most recent era, so the most recent era is expanded in the third scale. Since the Quaternary is a very short period with short epochs, it is further expanded in the fourth scale. The second, third, and fourth timelines are therefore each subsections of their preceding timeline as indicated by asterisks.

Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault. Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault.</h2><h3>What principle relates to the formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut? </h3><p>The principle of cross-cutting relationships</p><p>cross-cutting relationships</p><p>cross-cutting relationships</p><h3>When rock formations are found on top of a fault that have not been cut, then they must be older or younger than the fault?</h3><p>younger than the fault</p><p>younger</p><p>younger</p><h3>Finding what helps to determine if a fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault? </h3><p>the key bed</p><p>key bed</p><p>key bed</p><h3>Rocks on top of a fault that are cut are always older or younger than the fault itself?</h3><p>older than the fault</p><p>older</p><p>younger</p><h2>The principle of inclusions and components states that, with sedimentary rocks, if inclusions (or clasts) are found in a formation, then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them. For example, in sedimentary rocks, it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer. A similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when xenoliths are found. These foreign bodies are picked up as magma or lava flows, and are incorporated, later to cool in the matrix. As a result, xenoliths are older than the rock which contains them.</h2><h3>What foreign bodies, which are older than the rocks themselves, occur igneous rocks?</h3><p>xenoliths</p><p>xenoliths</p><p>inclusions</p><p>xenoliths</p><h3>Xenoliths are picked up by what and deposited into the matrix of igneous rocks? </h3><p>magma or lava flows</p><p>magma or lava flows</p><p>magma or lava</p><p>magma or lava flows</p><h3>What is another word for inclusions in sedimentary rocks? </h3><p>clasts</p><p>clasts</p><p>clasts</p><p>clasts</p><h3>What is the principle that states that with sedimentary rocks, inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them?</h3><p>The principle of inclusions and components</p><p>principle of inclusions and components</p><p>The principle of inclusions and components</p><p>inclusions and components</p><h3>What is something that is often torn up and included in sedimentary rock?</h3><p>gravel</p><p>gravel</p><p>gravel</p><p>gravel</p><h2>The principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks. As organisms exist at the same time period throughout the world, their presence or (sometimes) absence may be used to provide a relative age of the formations in which they are found. Based on principles laid out by William Smith almost a hundred years before the publication of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, the principles of succession were developed independently of evolutionary thought. The principle becomes quite complex, however, given the uncertainties of fossilization, the localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat (facies change in sedimentary strata), and that not all fossils may be found globally at the same time.</h2><h3>Which principle is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks?</h3><p>The principle of faunal succession</p><p>principle of faunal succession</p><p>The principle of faunal succession</p><p>faunal succession</p><h3>Whose principles were the principle of faunal succession built upon?</h3><p>William Smith</p><p>William Smith</p><p>William Smith</p><p>William Smith</p><h3>The fact that not all fossils may be found globally at the same time causes the principle to become what?</h3><p>complex</p><p>complex</p><p>complex</p><p>quite complex</p><h3>The presence or absence of what can be used to determine the relative age of the formations in which they are found? </h3><p>organisms</p><p>organisms</p><p>organisms</p><p>organisms</p><h3>The principle of faunal succession was developed 100 years before whose theory of evolution?</h3><p>Charles Darwin</p><p>Charles Darwin</p><p>Charles Darwin</p><p>Charles Darwin</p><h2>At the beginning of the 20th century, important advancement in geological science was facilitated by the ability to obtain accurate absolute dates to geologic events using radioactive isotopes and other methods. This changed the understanding of geologic time. Previously, geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another. With isotopic dates it became possible to assign absolute ages to rock units, and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material, converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages.</h2><h3>When was the ability to use radioactive isotopes to date rock formations developed?</h3><p>At the beginning of the 20th century</p><p>20th century</p><p>At the beginning of the 20th century</p><p>beginning of the 20th century</p><h3>What type of correlation was used previously to help date rock formations?</h3><p>stratigraphic correlation</p><p>stratigraphic</p><p>stratigraphic</p><p>stratigraphic</p><h3>It is now possible to convert old relative ages into what type of ages using isotopic dating?</h3><p>absolute ages</p><p>rock units</p><p>new absolute</p><h3>Previous to isotopic dating sections of rocks had to be dated using fossils and stratigraphic correlation relative to what? </h3><p>to one another</p><p>one another</p><p>one another</p><h3>When dating rocks, what is the absolute isotopic date applied to?</h3><p>fossil sequences</p><p>fossil sequences</p><p>fossil sequences</p><p>fossil sequences</p><h2>For many geologic applications, isotope ratios of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular closure temperature, the point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the crystal lattice. These are used in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies. Common methods include uranium-lead dating, potassium-argon dating, argon-argon dating and uranium-thorium dating. These methods are used for a variety of applications. Dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units which do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques. These methods can also be used to determine ages of pluton emplacement. Thermochemical techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust, the uplift of mountain ranges, and paleotopography.</h2><h3>What techniques can be used to determine paleotopography?</h3><p>Thermochemical techniques</p><p>Thermochemical</p><p>Thermochemical</p><p>Thermochemical</p><h3>The point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the crystal lattice is called what?</h3><p>particular closure temperature</p><p>closure temperature</p><p>closure temperature</p><h3>What type of ratios are used in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies?</h3><p>isotope ratios of radioactive elements</p><p>isotope</p><p>isotope</p><p>isotope</p><h3>How can you find the absolute age of sedimentary rock units which do not contain radioactive isotopes?</h3><p>Dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence</p><p>Dating of lava and volcanic ash layers</p><p>stratigraphic sequence</p><p>Dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence</p><h2>When rock units are placed under horizontal compression, they shorten and become thicker. Because rock units, other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways: through faulting and folding. In the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults form, which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically, and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating &quot;antiforms&quot;, or where it buckles downwards, creating &quot;synforms&quot;. If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and synclines, respectively. If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown, they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms and synforms.</h2><h3>Rock units become thicker and shorten when placed under this type of compression. </h3><p>horizontal compression</p><p>horizontal</p><p>horizontal</p><h3>Where do thrust faults form?</h3><p>In the shallow crust</p><p>shallow crust</p><p>shallow crust</p><h3>When rock folds deep in the Earth it can fold one of two ways, when it buckles upwards it creates what? </h3><p>antiforms</p><p>antiforms</p><p>antiforms</p><h3>When rock folds deep in the Earth it can fold one of two ways, when it buckles downwards it creates what? </h3><p>synforms</p><p>synforms</p><p>synforms</p><h3>If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called what? </h3><p>anticlines and synclines</p><p>overturned anticline</p><p>anticlines and synclines</p><h2>Extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner. This is primarily accomplished through normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning. Normal faults drop rock units that are higher below those that are lower. This typically results in younger units being placed below older units. Stretching of units can result in their thinning; in fact, there is a location within the Maria Fold and Thrust Belt in which the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon can be seen over a length of less than a meter. Rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed. These stretched rocks can also pinch into lenses, known as boudins, after the French word for &quot;sausage&quot;, because of their visual similarity.</h2><h3>This causes the rock unit as a whole to become longer and thinner. </h3><p>Extension</p><p>Extension</p><p>Extension</p><h3>Stretched rocks that pinch into lenses are known by what word? </h3><p>boudins</p><p>boudins</p><p>boudins</p><h3>Where can the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon be seen in less than the length of a meter?</h3><p>within the Maria Fold and Thrust Belt</p><p>Maria Fold and Thrust Belt</p><p>Maria Fold and Thrust Belt</p><h3>Rocks that are a depth where they are ductilely stretched are also often what?</h3><p>metamorphosed</p><p>metamorphosed</p><p>metamorphosed</p><h3>What causes rock extension?</h3><p>normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning</p><p>normal faulting</p><p>normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning</p><h2>The addition of new rock units, both depositionally and intrusively, often occurs during deformation. Faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients, causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels. These sediments are deposited on the rock unit that is going down. Continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment, and continues to create accommodation space for the material to deposit. Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity. Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below. Dikes, long, planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed. This can result in the emplacement of dike swarms, such as those that are observable across the Canadian shield, or rings of dikes around the lava tube of a volcano.</h2><h3>What is another word for long, planar igneous intrusions?</h3><p>Dikes</p><p>Dikes</p><p>Dikes</p><h3>Where do dikes form?</h3><p>in areas that are being actively deformed</p><p>areas that are being actively deformed</p><p>in areas that are being actively deformed</p><h3>What type of gradients are formed by faulting and other deformational processes?</h3><p>topographic gradients</p><p>topographic</p><p>topographic</p><h3>What activity maintains topographic gradients?</h3><p>Continual motion along the fault</p><p>Continual motion</p><p>Continual motion along the fault</p><h3>What events are often associated with volcanism and igneous activity?</h3><p>Deformational events</p><p>Deformational</p><p>Deformational</p><h2>All of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment, and do not necessarily occur in a single order. The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area.</h2><h3>The Hawaiian Islands are made up almost entirely of what?</h3><p>layered basaltic lava flows</p><p>layered basaltic lava flows</p><p>layered basaltic lava flows</p><h3>What is the oldest known rock in the world?</h3><p>Acasta gneiss</p><p>Acasta gneiss</p><p>Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada</p><h3>What type of rock is found at the Grand Canyon?</h3><p>sedimentary rocks</p><p>sedimentary</p><p>sedimentary</p><h3>The rocks at the Grand Canyon have been in place since when?</h3><p>Cambrian time</p><p>Cambrian time</p><p>Cambrian time</p><h3>Where is the oldest known rock in the world located?</h3><p>Slave craton in northwestern Canada</p><p>Canada</p><p>northwestern Canada</p><h2>Geologists use a number of field, laboratory, and numerical modeling methods to decipher Earth history and understand the processes that occur on and inside the Earth. In typical geological investigations, geologists use primary information related to petrology (the study of rocks), stratigraphy (the study of sedimentary layers), and structural geology (the study of positions of rock units and their deformation). In many cases, geologists also study modern soils, rivers, landscapes, and glaciers; investigate past and current life and biogeochemical pathways, and use geophysical methods to investigate the subsurface.</h2><h3>What is petrology?</h3><p>the study of rocks</p><p>study of rocks</p><p>the study of rocks</p><h3>What is stratigraphy?</h3><p>the study of sedimentary layers</p><p>study of sedimentary layers</p><p>the study of sedimentary layers</p><h3>What is structural geology?</h3><p>the study of positions of rock units and their deformation</p><p>study of positions of rock units and their deformation</p><p>the study of positions of rock units and their deformation</p><h3> What modern formations do geologists study?</h3><p>modern soils</p><p>soils, rivers, landscapes, and glaciers</p><p>soils, rivers, landscapes, and glaciers</p><h2>In addition to identifying rocks in the field, petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory. Two of the primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory are through optical microscopy and by using an electron microprobe.

In the electron microprobe, individual locations are analyzed for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals.

Numerical models work in the same way as these analog models, though they are often more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion and uplift in the mountain belt. This helps to show the relationship between erosion and the shape of the mountain range.

Abu al-Rayhan al-Biruni (973–1048 CE) was one of the earliest Persian geologists, whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of India, hypothesizing that the Indian subcontinent was once a sea. Drawing from Greek and Indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the Muslim conquests, the Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 981–1037) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains, the origin of earthquakes, and other topics central to modern geology, which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science. In China, the polymath Shen Kuo (1031–1095) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt.</h2><h3>Fielding H.

In 1785 he presented a paper entitled Theory of the Earth to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In his paper, he explained his theory that the Earth must be much older than had previously been supposed in order to allow enough time for mountains to be eroded and for sediments to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea, which in turn were raised up to become dry land. Hutton published a two-volume version of his ideas in 1795 (Vol. 1, Vol. 2).</h2><h3>Who is viewed as the first modern geologist?</h3><p>James Hutton</p><p>James Hutton</p><p>James Hutton</p><h3>In 1785 James Hutton presented what paper to the Royal Society of Edinburgh?</h3><p>Theory of the Earth</p><p>Theory of the Earth</p><p>Theory of the Earth</p><h3>James Hutton published a 2 volume version of his theories in what year?</h3><p>1795</p><p>1795</p><p>1795</p><h3>What was the main idea of James Hutton's paper?</h3><p>Earth must be much older than had previously been supposed</p><p>Earth must be much older than had previously been supposed</p><p>the Earth must be much older than had previously been supposed</p><h2>The first geological map of the U.S. was produced in 1809 by William Maclure. In 1807, Maclure commenced the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States. Almost every state in the Union was traversed and mapped by him, the Allegheny Mountains being crossed and recrossed some 50 times. The results of his unaided labours were submitted to the American Philosophical Society in a memoir entitled Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a Geological Map, and published in the Society's Transactions, together with the nation's first geological map. This antedates William Smith's geological map of England by six years, although it was constructed using a different classification of rocks.</h2><h3>Who produced the first geological map of the U.S.?</h3><p>William Maclure</p><p>William Maclure</p><p>William Maclure</p><h3>In what year was the first geological map of the U.S. produced?</h3><p>1809</p><p>1809</p><p>1809</p><h3>In what year did William Maclure begin the process of creating the first geological map of the U.S.?</h3><p>1807</p><p>1807</p><p>1807</p><h3>What was the memoir entitled which was submitted to the American Philosophical Society?</h3><p>Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a Geological Map</p><p>Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a Geological Map</p><p>Observations on the Geology of the United States</p><h3>To whom did William Maclure submit the map?</h3><p>the American Philosophical Society</p><p>American Philosophical Society</p><p>American Philosophical Society</p><h2>Sir Charles Lyell first published his famous book, Principles of Geology, in 1830. This book, which influenced the thought of Charles Darwin, successfully promoted the doctrine of uniformitarianism. This theory states that slow geological processes have occurred throughout the Earth's history and are still occurring today. In contrast, catastrophism is the theory that Earth's features formed in single, catastrophic events and remained unchanged thereafter. Though Hutton believed in uniformitarianism, the idea was not widely accepted at the time.</h2><h3>First published by Sir Charles Lyell in 1830 this book was called what? </h3><p>Principles of Geology</p><p>Principles of Geology</p><p>Principles of Geology</p><h3>What doctrine did the doctrine of the Principles of Geology successfully promote?</h3><p>uniformitarianism</p><p>uniformitarianism</p><p>uniformitarianism</p><h3>Which theory states that slow geological processes are still occurring today, and have occurred throughout Earth's history?</h3><p>uniformitarianism</p><p>uniformitarianism</p><p>uniformitarianism</p><h3>Which theory states that Earth's features remained unchanged after forming in one single catastrophic event?</h3><p>catastrophism</p><p>catastrophism</p><p>catastrophism</p><h3>Which famous evolutionist was influenced by the book Principles of Geology?</h3><p>Charles Darwin</p><p>Charles Darwin</p><p>Charles Darwin</p></div></body></html>
