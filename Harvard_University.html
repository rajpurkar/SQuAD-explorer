<html><body><div><h1>Harvard_University</h1><h2>Established originally by the Massachusetts legislature and soon thereafter named for John Harvard (its first benefactor), Harvard is the United States' oldest institution of higher learning, and the Harvard Corporation (formally, the President and Fellows of Harvard College) is its first chartered corporation. Although never formally affiliated with any denomination, the early College primarily trained Congregationalist and Unitarian clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites. Following the American Civil War, President Charles W. Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900. James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war. The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College.</h2><h3>What individual is the school named after?</h3><p>John Harvard</p><p>John Harvard</p><p>John Harvard</p><h3>When did the undergraduate program become coeducational?</h3><p>1977</p><p>1977</p><p>1977</p><h3>What was the name of the leader through the Great Depression and World War II?</h3><p>James Bryant Conant</p><p>James Bryant Conant</p><p>James Bryant Conant</p><h3>What organization did Harvard found in 1900?</h3><p>Association of American Universities</p><p>Association of American Universities</p><p>Association of American Universities</p><h3>What president of the university transformed it into a modern research university?</h3><p>Charles W.

The nominal cost of attendance is high, but the University's large endowment allows it to offer generous financial aid packages. It operates several arts, cultural, and scientific museums, alongside the Harvard Library, which is the world's largest academic and private library system, comprising 79 individual libraries with over 18 million volumes. Harvard's alumni include eight U.S. presidents, several foreign heads of state, 62 living billionaires, 335 Rhodes Scholars, and 242 Marshall Scholars. To date, some 150 Nobel laureates, 18 Fields Medalists and 13 Turing Award winners have been affiliated as students, faculty, or staff.</h2><h3>What is the worlds largest academic and private library system?</h3><p>Harvard Library</p><p>Harvard Library</p><p>Harvard</p><h3>How many individual libraries make up the main school library?</h3><p>79 individual libraries</p><p>79</p><p>79</p><h3>How many volumes are contained in the library?</h3><p>18 million volumes</p><p>18 million</p><p>over 18 million</p><h3>How many US presidents are alumni of the school?</h3><p>eight U.S. presidents</p><p>eight</p><p>eight</p><h3>How many Nobel Laureates are among the school alumni?</h3><p>150 Nobel laureates</p><p>150</p><p>150</p><h2>The University is organized into eleven separate academic units—ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study—with campuses throughout the Boston metropolitan area: its 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge, approximately 3 miles (5 km) northwest of Boston; the business school and athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston and the medical, dental, and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area.

It was initially called &quot;New College&quot; or &quot;the college at New Towne&quot;. In 1638, the college became home for North America's first known printing press, carried by the ship John of London. In 1639, the college was renamed Harvard College after deceased clergyman John Harvard, who was an alumnus of the University of Cambridge. He had left the school £779 and his library of some 400 books. The charter creating the Harvard Corporation was granted in 1650.</h2><h3>In what year was the school formed?</h3><p>1636</p><p>1636</p><p>1636</p><h3>What organization arranged to founding of school?</h3><p>Massachusetts Bay Colony</p><p>Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony</p><p>Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony</p><h3>What year was North America's first printing press started?</h3><p>1638</p><p>1638</p><p>1638</p><h3>In what year was the school renamed as Harvard College?</h3><p>1639</p><p>1639</p><p>1639</p><h3>In what year was the charter granted for Harvard Corporation?</h3><p>1650</p><p>1650</p><p>1650</p><h2>In the early years the College trained many Puritan ministers.[citation needed] (A 1643 publication said the school's purpose was &quot;to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust&quot;.) It offered a classic curriculum on the English university model—​​many leaders in the colony had attended the University of Cambridge—​​but conformed Puritanism. It was never affiliated with any particular denomination, but many of its earliest graduates went on to become clergymen in Congregational and Unitarian churches.</h2><h3>Ministers of what faith were trained by the university in early years?</h3><p>Puritan ministers</p><p>Puritan</p><p>Puritan</p><h3>After what higher learning model was the school designed?</h3><p>English university model</p><p>English university</p><p>English university</p><h3>Was the school officially associated with any denomination?</h3><p>It was never affiliated with any particular denomination</p><p>never</p><p>never</p><h2>Throughout the 18th century, Enlightenment ideas of the power of reason and free will became widespread among Congregationalist ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist, Calvinist parties.:1–4 When the Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan died in 1803 and the president of Harvard Joseph Willard died a year later, in 1804, a struggle broke out over their replacements. Henry Ware was elected to the chair in 1805, and the liberal Samuel Webber was appointed to the presidency of Harvard two years later, which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional ideas at Harvard to the dominance of liberal, Arminian ideas (defined by traditionalists as Unitarian ideas).:4–5:24</h2><h3>In what year did Harvard President Joseph Willard die?</h3><p>1804</p><p>1804</p><p>1804</p><h3>What liberal succeeded Joseph Willard as president?</h3><p>Samuel Webber</p><p>Samuel Webber</p><p>Samuel Webber</p><h3>In what year was Henry Ware elected to chair?</h3><p>1805</p><p>1805</p><p>1805</p><h2>In 1846, the natural history lectures of Louis Agassiz were acclaimed both in New York and on the campus at Harvard College. Agassiz's approach was distinctly idealist and posited Americans' &quot;participation in the Divine Nature&quot; and the possibility of understanding &quot;intellectual existences&quot;. Agassiz's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the &quot;divine plan&quot; in all phenomena. When it came to explaining life-forms, Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence. This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of Common Sense Realism derived from Scottish philosophers Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart, whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time. The popularity of Agassiz's efforts to &quot;soar with Plato&quot; probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed, including Platonic treatises by Ralph Cudworth, John Norrisand, in a Romantic vein, Samuel Coleridge. The library records at Harvard reveal that the writings of Plato and his early modern and Romantic followers were almost as regularly read during the 19th century as those of the &quot;official philosophy&quot; of the more empirical and more deistic Scottish school.</h2><h3>in 1846 who's natural history lectures were acclaimed in New York and Harvard?</h3><p>Louis Agassiz</p><p>Louis Agassiz</p><p>Louis Agassiz</p><h3>Agassiz's approach to science combined observation and what?</h3><p>intuition</p><p>intuition</p><p>intuition</p><h3>Common Sense Realism of what Scottish philosophers did Agassiz incorporate in his dual view of knowedge?</h3><p>Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart</p><p>Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart</p><p>Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart</p><h2>Charles W. Eliot, president 1869–1909, eliminated the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. While Eliot was the most crucial figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education, but by Transcendentalist Unitarian convictions. Derived from William Ellery Channing and Ralph Waldo Emerson, these convictions were focused on the dignity and worth of human nature, the right and ability of each person to perceive truth, and the indwelling God in each person.</h2><h3>What president eliminated the Christian position in the curriculum?</h3><p>Charles W.

He saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy, so Conant devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. In 1943, he asked the faculty make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be, at the secondary as well as the college level. The resulting Report, published in 1945, was one of the most influential manifestos in the history of American education in the 20th century.</h2><h3>Who lead the school back to leading research institution in 2oth century?</h3><p>James Bryant Conant</p><p>James Bryant Conant</p><p>James Bryant Conant</p><h3>How was the school able to bring aboard the best talented students?</h3><p>identify, recruit</p><p>Conant devised programs</p><p>programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth</p><h3>In what year of 20th century, did Harvard release an important document about education in America?</h3><p>1945</p><p>1945</p><p>1945</p><h2>Women remained segregated at Radcliffe, though more and more took Harvard classes. Nonetheless, Harvard's undergraduate population remained predominantly male, with about four men attending Harvard College for every woman studying at Radcliffe. Following the merger of Harvard and Radcliffe admissions in 1977, the proportion of female undergraduates steadily increased, mirroring a trend throughout higher education in the United States. Harvard's graduate schools, which had accepted females and other groups in greater numbers even before the college, also became more diverse in the post-World War II period.</h2><h3>What was the ratio of men to women at Harvard/Radcliffe?</h3><p>about four men attending Harvard College for every woman studying at Radcliffe</p><p>four men attending Harvard College for every woman studying at Radcliffe</p><p>four men attending Harvard College for every woman</p><h3>In what year did Harvard and Radcliffe admissions merge?</h3><p>1977</p><p>1977</p><p>1977</p><h3>What was the trend of female student population from 1970s and deyond?</h3><p>the proportion of female undergraduates steadily increased, mirroring a trend throughout higher education in the United States</p><p>steadily increased</p><p>increased</p><h2>Harvard's 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge, about 3 miles (5 km) west-northwest of the State House in downtown Boston, and extends into the surrounding Harvard Square neighborhood. Harvard Yard itself contains the central administrative offices and main libraries of the university, academic buildings including Sever Hall and University Hall, Memorial Church, and the majority of the freshman dormitories. Sophomore, junior, and senior undergraduates live in twelve residential Houses, nine of which are south of Harvard Yard along or near the Charles River. The other three are located in a residential neighborhood half a mile northwest of the Yard at the Quadrangle (commonly referred to as the Quad), which formerly housed Radcliffe College students until Radcliffe merged its residential system with Harvard. Each residential house contains rooms for undergraduates, House masters, and resident tutors, as well as a dining hall and library. The facilities were made possible by a gift from Yale University alumnus Edward Harkness.</h2><h3>How far from state house in downtown Boston is Harvard Yard?</h3><p>3 miles</p><p>3 miles</p><p>about 3 miles</p><h3>How many residential dorms house upper class, sophomore, Jr, and Sr students?</h3><p>twelve residential Houses</p><p>twelve</p><p>twelve</p><h3>Along what geographic feature are nine residential houses located?</h3><p>Charles River</p><p>Charles River</p><p>Charles River</p><h3>How far from the Yard is the Quad located?</h3><p>half a mile northwest of the Yard</p><p>half a mile</p><p>half a mile</p><h2>The Harvard Business School and many of the university's athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located on a 358-acre (145 ha) campus opposite the Cambridge campus in Allston. The John W. Weeks Bridge is a pedestrian bridge over the Charles River connecting both campuses. The Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Dental Medicine, and the Harvard School of Public Health are located on a 21-acre (8.5 ha) campus in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area approximately 3.3 miles (5.3 km) southwest of downtown Boston and 3.3 miles (5.3 km) south of the Cambridge campus.</h2><h3>Where is Harvard stadium located?</h3><p>Allston</p><p>Allston</p><p>on a 358-acre (145 ha) campus</p><h3>What is the name of the bridge that joins parts of the campus of the Charles River?</h3><p>The John W.

The university now owns approximately fifty percent more land in Allston than in Cambridge. Proposals to connect the Cambridge campus with the new Allston campus include new and enlarged bridges, a shuttle service and/or a tram. Plans also call for sinking part of Storrow Drive (at Harvard's expense) for replacement with park land and pedestrian access to the Charles River, as well as the construction of bike paths, and buildings throughout the Allston campus. The institution asserts that such expansion will benefit not only the school, but surrounding community, pointing to such features as the enhanced transit infrastructure, possible shuttles open to the public, and park space which will also be publicly accessible.</h2><h3>How much more land does the school own in Allston than Cambridge?</h3><p>approximately fifty percent</p><p>fifty percent</p><p>fifty percent more</p><h3>What are some proposals to connect campuses?</h3><p>new and enlarged bridges, a shuttle service and/or a tram.</p><p>new and enlarged bridges, a shuttle service and/or a tram</p><p>new and enlarged bridges, a shuttle service and/or a tram</p><h3>What additional benefits are there to surrounding community of expansion?</h3><p>enhanced transit infrastructure, possible shuttles open to the public, and park space which will also be publicly accessible.</p><p>enhanced transit infrastructure, possible shuttles open to the public, and park space which will also be publicly accessible</p><p>enhanced transit infrastructure, possible shuttles open to the public, and park space</p><h2>Harvard's 2,400 professors, lecturers, and instructors instruct 7,200 undergraduates and 14,000 graduate students. The school color is crimson, which is also the name of the Harvard sports teams and the daily newspaper, The Harvard Crimson. The color was unofficially adopted (in preference to magenta) by an 1875 vote of the student body, although the association with some form of red can be traced back to 1858, when Charles William Eliot, a young graduate student who would later become Harvard's 21st and longest-serving president (1869–1909), bought red bandanas for his crew so they could more easily be distinguished by spectators at a regatta.</h2><h3>What is the total number of professors, instructors, and lecturers at Harvard?</h3><p>2,400</p><p>2,400</p><p>2,400</p><h3>What is the enrollment of undergraduates at Harvard?</h3><p>7,200</p><p>7,200</p><p>7,200</p><h3>How many graduate students does Harvard have?</h3><p>14,000</p><p>14,000</p><p>14,000</p><h3>When was the color crimson adopted at Harvard as official color?</h3><p>1875</p><p>1875</p><p>1875</p><h3>What year is the earliest traces of the color Crimson at Harvard?</h3><p>1858</p><p>1858</p><p>1858</p><h2>Harvard has the largest university endowment in the world.

It suffered about 30% loss in 2008-09. In December 2008, Harvard announced that its endowment had lost 22% (approximately $8 billion) from July to October 2008, necessitating budget cuts. Later reports suggest the loss was actually more than double that figure, a reduction of nearly 50% of its endowment in the first four months alone. Forbes in March 2009 estimated the loss to be in the range of $12 billion. One of the most visible results of Harvard's attempt to re-balance its budget was their halting of construction of the $1.2 billion Allston Science Complex that had been scheduled to be completed by 2011, resulting in protests from local residents. As of 2012[update], Harvard University had a total financial aid reserve of $159 million for students, and a Pell Grant reserve of $4.093 million available for disbursement.</h2><h3>What was the Harvard endowment total in 2011?</h3><p>$32 billion</p><p>$32 billion</p><p>$32 billion</p><h3>How great were the losses suffered in the the financial crisis of 2008-09 to Harvard endowment?</h3><p>30% loss</p><p>$12 billion</p><p>30% loss</p><h3>What project did Harvard halt due to the financial crisis?</h3><p>Allston Science Complex</p><p>Allston Science Complex</p><p>construction of the $1.2 billion Allston Science Complex</p><h3>What are Harvard's Pell grant reserves?</h3><p>$4.093 million</p><p>$4.093 million</p><p>$4.093 million</p><h3>What is Harvard's total financial aid reserves?</h3><p>$159 million</p><p>$159 million</p><p>$159 million</p><h2>During the divestment from South Africa movement in the late 1980s, student activists erected a symbolic &quot;shantytown&quot; on Harvard Yard and blockaded a speech given by South African Vice Consul Duke Kent-Brown. The Harvard Management Company repeatedly refused to divest, stating that &quot;operating expenses must not be subject to financially unrealistic strictures or carping by the unsophisticated or by special interest groups.&quot; However, the university did eventually reduce its South African holdings by $230 million (out of $400 million) in response to the pressure.</h2><h3>When was the divestment from South Africa movement? </h3><p>late 1980s</p><p>late 1980s</p><p>1980s</p><h3>What South African Vice Consul did Harvard students blockade the speech of? </h3><p>South African Vice Consul Duke Kent-Brown.</p><p>Duke Kent-Brown</p><p>Duke Kent-Brown</p><h3>By how much did Harvard management reduce its South Africa holdings in response to pressure?</h3><p>$230 million</p><p>$230 million</p><p>$230 million</p><h2>Undergraduate admission to Harvard is characterized by the Carnegie Foundation as &quot;more selective, lower transfer-in&quot;.

Between 1978 and 2008, entering students were required to complete a core curriculum of seven classes outside of their concentration. Since 2008, undergraduate students have been required to complete courses in eight General Education categories: Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding, Culture and Belief, Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning, Ethical Reasoning, Science of Living Systems, Science of the Physical Universe, Societies of the World, and United States in the World. Harvard offers a comprehensive doctoral graduate program and there is a high level of coexistence between graduate and undergraduate degrees. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, The New York Times, and some students have criticized Harvard for its reliance on teaching fellows for some aspects of undergraduate education; they consider this to adversely affect the quality of education.</h2><h3>Between 1978 an d2008 four year full time undergraduate students were required to complete how many classes outside of their concentration?</h3><p>core curriculum of seven classes</p><p>seven</p><p>seven</p><h3>Post 2008 undergraduate students are required to complete how many general education classes towards degree?</h3><p>eight General Education categories</p><p>eight</p><p>eight</p><h3>What criticism in NY times article that impacts the quality of Education at Harvard?</h3><p>reliance on teaching fellows</p><p>reliance on teaching fellows</p><p>reliance on teaching fellows</p><h2>Harvard's academic programs operate on a semester calendar beginning in early September and ending in mid-May. Undergraduates typically take four half-courses per term and must maintain a four-course rate average to be considered full-time. In many concentrations, students can elect to pursue a basic program or an honors-eligible program requiring a senior thesis and/or advanced course work. Students graduating in the top 4–5% of the class are awarded degrees summa cum laude, students in the next 15% of the class are awarded magna cum laude, and the next 30% of the class are awarded cum laude. Harvard has chapters of academic honor societies such as Phi Beta Kappa and various committees and departments also award several hundred named prizes annually. Harvard, along with other universities, has been accused of grade inflation, although there is evidence that the quality of the student body and its motivation have also increased. Harvard College reduced the number of students who receive Latin honors from 90% in 2004 to 60% in 2005.

Harvard has an intense athletic rivalry with Yale University culminating in The Game, although the Harvard–Yale Regatta predates the football game. This rivalry, though, is put aside every two years when the Harvard and Yale Track and Field teams come together to compete against a combined Oxford University and Cambridge University team, a competition that is the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world.</h2><h3>How many intercollegiate sports does Harvard compete in NCAA division I</h3><p>42</p><p>42</p><p>42</p><h3>What is Harvard's most intense rival?</h3><p>Yale University</p><p>Yale</p><p>Yale University</p><h3>At what time is the Harvard-Yale rivalry set aside?</h3><p>every two years when the Harvard and Yale Track and Field teams come together to compete against a combined Oxford University and Cambridge University team</p><p>every two years</p><p>every two years</p><h2>Harvard's athletic rivalry with Yale is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in the annual football meeting, which dates back to 1875 and is usually called simply &quot;The Game&quot;. While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often was a century ago during football's early days (it won the Rose Bowl in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the forward pass, perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.</h2><h3>What was the first year that Yale and Harvard played football?</h3><p>1875</p><p>1875</p><p>1875</p><h3>In what year did Harvard Stadium become the first ever concrete reinforced stadium in the country?</h3><p>1903</p><p>1903</p><p>1903</p><h3>In what year was a set of significant rule changes introduced including the forward pass?</h3><p>1906</p><p>1906</p><p>1906</p><h3>What school was Walter Camp a captain for the football team?</h3><p>former captain of the Yale football team</p><p>Yale</p><p>Yale</p><h2>Harvard has several athletic facilities, such as the Lavietes Pavilion, a multi-purpose arena and home to the Harvard basketball teams. The Malkin Athletic Center, known as the &quot;MAC&quot;, serves both as the university's primary recreation facility and as a satellite location for several varsity sports. The five-story building includes two cardio rooms, an Olympic-size swimming pool, a smaller pool for aquaerobics and other activities, a mezzanine, where all types of classes are held, an indoor cycling studio, three weight rooms, and a three-court gym floor to play basketball. The MAC offers personal trainers and specialty classes. It is home to Harvard volleyball, fencing and wrestling. The offices of several of the school's varsity coaches are also in the MAC.</h2><h3>What is the name of Harvard's basketball facility?</h3><p>Lavietes Pavilion</p><p>Lavietes Pavilion</p><p>Lavietes Pavilion</p><h3>What is the name of Harvard's primary recreational sports facility?</h3><p>Malkin Athletic Center</p><p>Malkin Athletic Center</p><p>Malkin Athletic Center</p><h3>How many weight rooms are in the Malkin Athletic Center</h3><p>three weight rooms</p><p>three</p><p>three</p><h2>Older than The Game by 23 years, the Harvard-Yale Regatta was the original source of the athletic rivalry between the two schools. It is held annually in June on the Thames River in eastern Connecticut. The Harvard crew is typically considered to be one of the top teams in the country in rowing. Today, Harvard fields top teams in several other sports, such as the Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey team (with a strong rivalry against Cornell), squash, and even recently won NCAA titles in Men's and Women's Fencing. Harvard also won the Intercollegiate Sailing Association National Championships in 2003.</h2><h3>Harvard - Yale Regatta predates &quot;The Game&quot; by how many years?</h3><p>23 years</p><p>23</p><p>23</p><h3>In what body of water is the Harvard - Yale Regatta held?</h3><p>Thames River</p><p>Thames River</p><p>Thames River</p><h3>Who is the primary rival of the Harvard Crimson hockey team?</h3><p>strong rivalry against Cornell</p><p>Cornell</p><p>Cornell</p><h3>In what year did Harvard win an Intercolleiate Sailing Association National Championship?</h3><p>2003</p><p>2003</p><p>2003</p><h2>Politics: U.N.
